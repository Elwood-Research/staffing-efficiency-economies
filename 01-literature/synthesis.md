# Research Synthesis: Staffing Mix Efficiency and Economies of Scale

## Theoretical Framework and Conceptual Model

The research examining the relationship between facility size and staffing mix efficiency operates within a multi-theoretical framework integrating **Donabedian's Structure-Process-Outcome Model**, **Transaction Cost Economics**, and **Agency Theory**. These frameworks collectively explain why facility size might influence staffing composition and contract labor reliance.

Donabedian's framework positions staffing (structure) as a fundamental determinant of care processes and resident outcomes. Transaction cost economics suggests that facility size affects operational efficiency through the distribution of fixed costs against a larger resident population, but also increases coordination and information processing costs. Larger facilities face greater complexity in workforce management, care coordination, and quality oversight. Agency theory explains that organizational incentives (particularly in for-profit settings) influence staffing decisions, with facilities substituting less costly workers for more costly ones when financial pressures warrant.

These theoretical lenses converge on a critical insight: **the relationship between facility size and staffing efficiency is non-linear rather than monotonic**. Larger facilities may achieve cost advantages through administrative consolidation and purchasing power, but face offsetting complexity costs. Mid-sized facilities may face a "compression zone" where they are too large to operate with purely flexible staffing but too small to achieve the administrative economies of large systems, potentially forcing greater reliance on contract labor.

## Major Themes from Current Literature

### Staffing Composition and Facility Size
Current evidence demonstrates substantial variation in nursing home staffing levels and composition. Recent research (Shin et al., 2024; Kang et al., 2024) indicates that staffing patterns vary significantly by facility characteristics, including size and location. However, the literature provides limited direct evidence about how RN-to-LPN ratios specifically vary with facility size. Facilities appear to adjust staffing composition in response to regulatory and financial pressures (Huang et al., 2025 found MSSP participation increased RN staffing while reducing LPN staffing), but systematic analysis of size-related patterns remains underdeveloped.

### Economics of Scale: Mixed Evidence
Economic analyses of nursing home efficiency present a complex picture. While Christensen (2003) and Farsi et al. (2008) document economies of scale in nursing home operations, these benefits are heterogeneous across the facility size distribution. Diseconomies of scale appear in lower-cost facilities, suggesting that "optimal" facility size varies depending on local market conditions. This heterogeneity is critical: it implies that simply moving toward larger facilities will not uniformly improve efficiency or staffing patterns.

### Contract Labor as a Flexibility Strategy
Research indicates that contract labor use carries significant financial costs (Ghiasi et al., 2023: 10% increase in contract nurses → 0.45-0.52% decrease in operating margin) and quality costs (Khoja et al., 2026: higher agency use associated with increased falls). Yet facilities continue using contract staffing, suggesting it serves a critical function despite its costs. This pattern is consistent with the hypothesis that mid-sized facilities, lacking the recruiting advantages of large systems but unable to absorb the fixed costs of full-time staffing, may rely more heavily on contract workers.

### Staffing Instability and Outcomes
Recent evidence (Benheim et al., 2025) establishes that staffing instability matters for resident outcomes, independent of overall staffing levels. This finding has not yet been linked to facility size, but raises the question: do mid-sized facilities experience greater staffing instability due to their reliance on contract labor?

## Specific Research Gaps Addressed by the Proposed Study

The literature reveals critical gaps:

1. **Direct size-staffing relationships remain underspecified**: While research documents staffing levels and efficiency, limited work explicitly examines whether and how facility size influences RN-to-LPN ratios or contract CNA reliance using contemporary data.

2. **Contract labor patterns by facility size are unknown**: The hypothesis that mid-sized facilities show peak contract labor reliance (inverted-U pattern) lacks empirical testing, though theoretical foundations suggest this pattern is plausible.

3. **Payroll-Based Journal data offer new measurement opportunities**: Since 2018, PBJ data have provided facility-level payroll records including employment classification (employee vs. contract). Previous research relied on surveys or claims data; this study can use comprehensive national data for precise measurement.

4. **Mechanisms remain unclear**: Does larger size improve RN recruitment? Do larger facilities face coordination challenges that offset economies of scale? Do mid-sized facilities use contract labor due to inflexible staffing requirements or financial constraints?

## Proposed Hypotheses and Expected Findings

**H1: RN-to-LPN ratios increase with facility size (MDScensus)**: Larger facilities may have stronger recruiting capacity for RNs, enabling shift toward higher-skill staffing. Alternatively, larger facilities may achieve RN coverage through standardization and administrative efficiencies that smaller facilities cannot replicate.

**H2: Contract CNA reliance peaks in mid-sized facilities (inverted-U pattern)**: Mid-sized facilities lack the recruiting and administrative advantages of large systems but face pressure to maintain staffing levels. They may rely on contract CNAs as a flexibility response. Large facilities may achieve contract labor reductions through better recruiting and scheduling. Small facilities may accept higher reliance on contract labor as a viable operational model.

## Operationalization and Data Strategy

The Payroll-Based Journal (PBJ) data from 2018-2025 enable measurement of:
- **Facility Size**: Median daily census (MDScensus)
- **RN-to-LPN Ratio**: Hours per resident day for RNs divided by LPN HPRD
- **Contract CNA Reliance**: Proportion of CNA hours from contract/temporary workers (identified through employment classification variables)
- **Confounders**: Medicaid percentage, ownership type, geographic location, quality metrics, occupancy rate

## Implications for Policy and Practice

If confirmed, these hypotheses have important implications:

1. **Efficiency benefits may be facility-size dependent**: One-size-fits-all staffing mandates may not reflect efficient operations across the size distribution of facilities.

2. **Mid-sized facilities face unique challenges**: Policy and support mechanisms may need to target mid-sized facilities specifically, recognizing their structural constraints.

3. **Contract labor represents a quality and financial concern**: High contract labor reliance is associated with costs that undermine financial viability and compromised quality. Understanding why facilities rely on it (constraints vs. choices) is essential for policy design.

4. **Staffing composition matters**: Regulatory focus should extend beyond total staffing hours to consider skill mix and staffing stability, which recent evidence suggests are critical for quality.

## Conclusion

The current literature establishes that nursing home staffing decisions reflect complex interactions between facility characteristics, labor markets, regulations, and finances. The proposed research directly addresses an empirical gap in understanding whether facility size influences staffing mix efficiency and contract labor reliance through an inverted-U pattern. Using comprehensive Payroll-Based Journal data, this study will clarify the mechanisms by which facility size affects staffing strategy, identify whether larger facilities achieve true efficiency advantages in staffing, and provide evidence to inform policy discussions about optimal facility characteristics for efficient, quality care delivery in an industry facing persistent staffing challenges.
