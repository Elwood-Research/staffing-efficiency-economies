- **Pre-reference context**: 2 paragraphs explaining study population and selection criteria
- **Interpretation**: 2 paragraphs explaining exclusion counts and final sample
- **Data provided**: Selection flowchart with all exclusion criteria clearly labeled
- **Status**: PASS

### ✓ FIGURE 1a: Census Distribution
- **Referenced**: YES (line ~175)
- **Pre-reference narrative**: "Figure~\ref{fig:census_dist} illustrates the distribution of facility size across the sample"
- **Interpretation**: 2 paragraphs describing distribution shape, median, percentile ranges
- **Specific numbers**: "The distribution is approximately symmetric with slight right skew...The 10th percentile facility maintained 29 residents...while the 90th percentile facility maintained 132 residents"
- **Status**: PASS

### ✓ FIGURE 1b: RN-to-LPN Ratio Distribution
- **Referenced**: YES (line ~190)
- **Pre-reference narrative**: Sentence introducing the figure before it appears
- **Interpretation**: 3 paragraphs describing distribution characteristics, median, IQR, practical meaning
- **Key narrative**: "The distribution is substantially right-skewed, with most facilities concentrated between 0.25 and 0.75...This compressed range despite 14-fold variation in facility size suggests that factors other than size drive staffing composition"
- **Status**: PASS

### ✓ FIGURE 1c: Contract CNA Distribution
- **Referenced**: YES (line ~200)
- **Interpretation**: 2 paragraphs describing skewed distribution, 31% zero value, implications
- **Key narrative**: "The distribution is highly skewed, with 31% of facilities employing zero percent contract CNAs...most facilities rely primarily on direct-hire CNAs and supplement occasionally with temporary workers"
- **Status**: PASS

### ✓ TABLE 1: Facility Characteristics by Decile
- **Referenced**: YES (line ~177)
- **Pre-reference narrative**: "Table~\ref{tab:facility_chars} presents facility characteristics stratified by census decile"
- **Interpretation**: 3 paragraphs summarizing patterns across deciles
- **Key finding**: "The RN-to-LPN ratio column reveals an unexpected pattern. Rather than increasing with facility size (as H1 predicted), the RN-to-LPN ratio declines from decile 1 to decile 10"
- **Specific numbers**: Describes pattern from 2.07 (decile 1) to 0.57 (decile 10)
- **Status**: PASS

### ✓ FIGURE 2: H1 Spline Fit (RN-to-LPN vs. Facility Size)
- **Referenced**: YES (line ~188)
- **Pre-reference narrative**: Complete paragraph before figure
- **Interpretation**: 2 paragraphs explaining spline fit, negative trend, confidence intervals, practical implications
- **Key narrative**: "The negative trend is evident across the entire facility size spectrum, with the fitted line declining from approximately 0.80 at 25-resident facilities to approximately 0.25 at 200-resident facilities"
- **Status**: PASS

### ✓ FIGURE 3: H2 Spline Fit (Contract CNA vs. Facility Size)
- **Referenced**: YES (line ~212)
- **Pre-reference narrative**: Complete paragraph before figure
- **Interpretation**: 2 paragraphs explaining flat relationship, absence of predicted inverted-U, implications
- **Key narrative**: "The fitted line is nearly horizontal across the entire facility size range, visually confirming the statistical non-significance...contrast in robustness between these two findings is instructive"
- **Status**: PASS

### ✓ TABLE 2: H1 Regression Results
- **Referenced**: YES (line ~188)
- **Pre-reference narrative**: "Table~\ref{tab:h1_results} presents the full regression results"
- **Interpretation**: 3 paragraphs discussing coefficient, significance, confidence interval, practical meaning
- **Specific discussion**: Explains how coefficient translates to actual facility differences
- **Status**: PASS

### ✓ TABLE 3: H2 Regression Results
- **Referenced**: YES (line ~206)
- **Interpretation**: Full paragraph explaining non-significant linear and quadratic terms

## ACADEMIC WRITING QUALITY VERIFICATION

### ✓ VERBOSE ACADEMIC PROSE
- **All sections structured as 3-5+ paragraph prose** (no bullet-point-only sections)
- **Complex sentences with transitions**: "Yet the industry confronts persistent staffing challenges: chronic shortages of registered nurses, high turnover among certified nursing assistants, and increasing reliance on contract labor despite evidence that temporary workers may compromise care quality and increase costs."
- **Integration of citations throughout**: Not relegated to one section but woven throughout
- **Status**: PASS

### ✓ THEORETICAL FRAMEWORK INTEGRATION
- **Section 1.1 "Theoretical Framework"** (3 full paragraphs)
  - Paragraph 1: TCE principles and predictions
  - Paragraph 2: Donabedian model explanation
  - Paragraph 3: Agency Theory and synthesis
- **Discussion Section 6.4** dedicated to "Theoretical Implications" (1 page)
  - Addresses TCE qualifications
  - Discusses Donabedian framework limitations
  - Proposes modified applications
- **Status**: PASS

### ✓ LITERATURE SYNTHESIS (Not Mere Listing)
- **Introduction organized by themes** (not chronological listing)
  - Theme 1: Economies of scale in healthcare (3-4 studies compared and contrasted)
  - Theme 2: Staffing levels and outcomes (5+ studies integrated by conceptual contribution)
  - Theme 3: Labor market constraints and geographic variation (4+ studies showing constraints override optimization)
  - Theme 4: Contract labor use and implications (3+ studies on costs and functions)
- **Synthesis example**: "Multiple studies document economies of scale in nursing home operations, though scale effects are heterogeneous and context-dependent. Christensen (2003) identified economies of scale in average cost functions using Connecticut data but also noted diseconomies of scale at extreme facility sizes. Farsi and colleagues (2008), analyzing Swiss nursing homes, concluded that 'optimal facility size varies depending on local market conditions,' implying that scale effects are heterogeneous and context-dependent."
- **Introduction approximately 3.5 pages of literature synthesis**
- **Status**: PASS

### ✓ HYPOTHESIS CONTRADICTION HANDLING
- **Abstract explicitly states contradictions**:
  - "Contrary to Transaction Cost Economics predictions, larger facilities maintained significantly lower RN-to-LPN ratios"
  - "This finding...contradicts the hypothesis that larger facilities achieve efficiency-driven improvements in staffing mix"
- **Discussion Section 6.1** provides three competing mechanisms:
  1. Regulatory ceiling hypothesis (with citations: Bowblis & Brunt 2024, Zhang & Grabowski 2004, Shin et al. 2024)
  2. Labor market constraint hypothesis (with citations: Brazier et al. 2023, Kang et al. 2024, Lanoix 2021, Levy et al. 2025)
  3. Process innovation hypothesis (with citations: Huang et al. 2025, Cho et al. 2020, Bowblis & Brunt 2024)
- **Status**: PASS
