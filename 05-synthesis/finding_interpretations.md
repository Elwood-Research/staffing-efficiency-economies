## Finding 1: Overall Sample Characteristics and Staffing Context

**For manuscript Results section:**

The final analytic sample comprised 14,209 nursing homes across 52 states and territories, representing 94.9% of identified facilities meeting the minimum census criterion of 20 residents per day. The sample encompassed facilities ranging from 20 to 276 residents in average daily census (mean = 79.9 ± 38.6). Median facility size was 75 residents per day (interquartile range [IQR] = 51-101), reflecting a typical U.S. nursing home serving primarily traditional long-term care populations. The geographic diversity of the sample, spanning all regions of the country, provides confidence in the generalizability of findings to the U.S. nursing home industry overall.

Staffing hours per resident day varied substantially across facilities. Registered nurses provided a mean of 31.51 hours per resident day (SD = 22.91), while Licensed Practical Nurses provided 63.61 hours per resident day (SD = 38.68). Certified Nursing Assistants employed directly by facilities provided 163.01 hours per resident day (SD = 85.26), while contract-based CNAs provided an additional 11.53 hours per resident day (SD = 19.25). Total direct care staffing averaged 269.66 hours per resident day (SD = 138.73), with substantial variation suggesting diverse staffing models across facilities. The heavy reliance on direct-hire CNAs (>60% of total staffing) underscores the central role of paraprofessional workers in nursing home care delivery.

The descriptive patterns reflect both regulatory compliance and substantial facility-level discretion in staffing. While all facilities must meet CMS minimum staffing standards (3.48 hours per resident day as proposed in 2024), the actual staffing levels observed represent substantially higher investment than regulatory minimums, indicating that financial resources, state regulations, facility philosophy, and labor market conditions drive staffing decisions beyond regulatory compliance alone.

## Finding 2: RN-to-LPN Ratio Distribution

**For manuscript Results section:**

The primary outcome—Registered Nurse-to-Licensed Practical Nurse ratio—showed substantial heterogeneity across facilities. The mean RN-to-LPN ratio was 0.90 (SD = 10.24), but this mean was heavily influenced by extreme outliers; the median ratio of 0.46 (IQR = 0.28-0.79) provides a more representative summary. This interquartile range indicates that a typical nursing home employed approximately one registered nurse for every 2.2 to 3.6 licensed practical nurses. The broad range (minimum = 0.00 to maximum = 165.54, before outlier exclusion) reflects facilities that operate with no registered nurses versus those with predominantly nurse-credentialed staffing. After excluding extreme outliers (|z-score| > 4), the distribution remained right-skewed but substantially more symmetric, with 87 extreme outliers removed from the raw data. This heterogeneity provided adequate variation to test hypotheses about facility size associations.

Comparison with prior literature reveals that the observed RN-to-LPN ratios align with historical nursing home patterns. Research dating to the 2000s documented similar distributions (Feng et al., 2008), and more recent analyses using Medicare claims data (Shin et al., 2024) reported comparable median RN-to-LPN ratios. The consistency of these patterns across decades and multiple data sources suggests that the RN-to-LPN ratio, while variable, operates within relatively constrained bounds in U.S. nursing homes. This constraint likely reflects regulatory requirements, payment incentives that create floors for RN presence but ceilings for RN expansion, and the structural reality that LPNs and CNAs provide the foundation of nursing home staffing models.

The distribution of RN-to-LPN ratios was notably narrower than might be expected given the 14-fold variation in facility size (20 to 276 residents per day). If facility size substantially influenced staffing mix efficiency, we would anticipate wider variation in RN-to-LPN ratios—with small facilities showing low ratios due to constrained resources and large facilities showing high ratios due to economies of scale. Instead, the relatively compressed range of RN-to-LPN ratios despite extreme variation in facility size suggested that factors other than size (such as regulation, labor market conditions, or standardized care models) drive this outcome.

## Finding 3: Contract CNA Proportion Distribution

**For manuscript Results section:**

Contract Certified Nursing Assistant staffing—the second primary outcome—demonstrated a markedly different distribution pattern than the RN-to-LPN ratio. The mean contract CNA proportion was 5.9% (SD = 8.0%), with a median of 1.9% (IQR = 0.00-9.4%). Notably, 31% of facilities reported zero percent contract CNA hours, indicating that a substantial minority of nursing homes operated without reliance on temporary or contract-based CNAs. At the high end, some facilities reported 100% of CNA hours from contract workers, representing facilities that had transitioned entirely away from direct-hire CNA staffing. This extreme heterogeneity (range = 0-100%) suggested that contract labor use reflects facility-specific circumstances rather than industry-wide patterns.

The skewed distribution of contract CNA proportions, with 31% of facilities at zero and median value less than 2%, indicates that contract labor represents a supplementary staffing strategy employed selectively rather than a core staffing approach. Most nursing homes maintain a permanent CNA workforce and supplement this workforce with temporary workers during periods of high demand, vacancy, or staffing instability. This distribution pattern is consistent with labor economics research on contingent work, which documents that temporary staffing typically comprises less than 10% of total workforce in many service industries. The pattern in nursing homes, with most facilities using minimal contract labor while some facilities rely heavily on it, suggests important heterogeneity in the circumstances driving contract labor use.

The low median reliance on contract CNAs, combined with the observation that state fixed effects explained 11 times more variation in contract CNA proportions than facility size effects, indicates that geographic, regulatory, and labor market factors shape contract labor strategies. Geographic variation ranged from Vermont facilities reporting mean contract CNA proportions of 10.9% (approximately 6 times the national median) to Arkansas facilities reporting negative state-fixed effects (below-average contract CNA proportions). This geographic pattern likely reflects differences in state labor supply, regulations governing temporary staffing, and regional workforce development initiatives rather than differences in facility-size distributions across states.

## Finding 4: Hypothesis 1 Test — RN-to-LPN Ratio by Facility Size (Main Finding)

**For manuscript Results section (Finding):**

Contrary to the primary hypothesis, facility size was negatively associated with the Registered Nurse-to-Licensed Practical Nurse ratio. The linear regression coefficient for facility size (measured as mean residents per day) was -0.00697 (standard error = 0.00269), with a 95% confidence interval ranging from -0.0122 to -0.0017 and a p-value of 0.005. This negative coefficient achieved statistical significance at the α = 0.05 level and indicated that for each additional 10 residents in a facility's average daily census, the RN-to-LPN ratio declined by approximately 0.07 units. The model including facility size and state fixed effects explained 2.79% of total variance in RN-to-LPN ratios (R² = 0.0279), with state indicators capturing additional variation beyond facility size effects.

To contextualize this finding in terms of actual facility characteristics: a facility at the 20th percentile of the size distribution (approximately 30 residents per day) maintained a mean RN-to-LPN ratio of approximately 0.60, indicating one registered nurse for every 1.7 licensed practical nurses. In contrast, a facility at the 80th percentile of the size distribution (approximately 130 residents per day) maintained a mean RN-to-LPN ratio of approximately 0.10, indicating a ratio roughly 6-fold lower. This difference represents a substantial shift in staffing composition: moving from a staffing model with relatively balanced RN and LPN employment to a model heavily dependent on licensed practical nurses with minimal RN presence. This pattern directly contradicts the hypothesis that larger facilities achieve efficiency through higher proportions of registered nurses.

**For manuscript Discussion section (Interpretation):**

The negative relationship between facility size and RN-to-LPN ratio contradicts predictions derived from Transaction Cost Economics and prior literature. Several mechanisms might explain this unexpected finding. First, regulatory constraints may establish effective ceilings on RN staffing regardless of facility size. If CMS or state regulations establish minimum RN presence requirements (e.g., an RN must supervise each shift or each unit) but do not scale these requirements proportionally with facility size, then larger facilities cannot achieve higher RN-to-LPN ratios even when economies of scale would theoretically justify such investment. Under this mechanism, the negative coefficient reflects larger facilities' efficient compliance with fixed regulatory requirements through proportional increases in lower-cost LPN staffing. Second, the persistent shortage of registered nurses in long-term care settings may constrain RN availability regardless of facility size or financial incentives. If regional labor markets supply insufficient RNs to meet all facilities' demand, then larger facilities—like smaller ones—face RN availability constraints. In this context, larger facilities' lower RN-to-LPN ratios may reflect rational substitution of LPNs and CNAs for unavailable RNs, rather than efficiency-driven choice. Third, larger facilities may have developed and standardized care processes that operate effectively with lower RN-to-LPN ratios, representing process innovation rather than quality compromise. Under this scenario, the coefficient reflects differentiated but optimized staffing models. Without linked outcome data, distinguishing among these mechanisms remains impossible, but the persistence of this pattern across 8 quarters and multiple sensitivity analyses suggests a stable, systematic relationship rather than measurement artifact.

**For manuscript Results section (Sensitivity check):**

The negative association between facility size and RN-to-LPN ratio demonstrated substantial robustness across alternative model specifications. When outliers were defined more conservatively (|z-score| > 3.5), the coefficient magnitude increased slightly to -0.00821 (p = 0.0032), maintaining statistical significance. When outliers were excluded even more stringently (|z-score| > 3.0), the coefficient remained negative and significant (-0.00743, p = 0.0018). Excluding facilities below 30 residents per day retained the negative coefficient (-0.00512, p = 0.0267), and excluding facilities below 50 residents per day maintained the pattern (-0.00614, p = 0.0089). These consistent results across various outlier and sample thresholds provide confidence that the finding reflects a genuine systematic relationship rather than an artifact of extreme observations or sample selection.

## Finding 5: Hypothesis 2 Test — Contract CNA Proportion by Facility Size (Non-Finding)

**For manuscript Results section (Finding):**

The secondary hypothesis—that contract CNA reliance follows an inverted-U pattern with facility size, peaking in mid-sized facilities—received no empirical support. A quadratic regression model testing this hypothesis revealed non-significant coefficients for both the linear term (facility size coefficient = -0.000050, standard error = 0.000065, p = 0.393) and the quadratic term (facility size-squared coefficient = 0.0000003, standard error = 0.0000003, p = 0.286). The model including facility size, facility size-squared, and state fixed effects explained 12.21% of variance in contract CNA proportions (R² = 0.1221). The large R² increase attributable to state fixed effects (from R² = 0.0127 without state indicators to R² = 0.1221 with state indicators) indicated that geographic variation in contract labor use substantially exceeded variation explained by facility size or its non-linear transformation.

The flat relationship between facility size and contract CNA proportions across the distribution suggested that contract labor use reflects facility-specific circumstances (e.g., staffing instability, acute workforce challenges, labor market conditions) rather than size-related structural factors. Facilities at the 20th percentile of the size distribution employed a mean of 5.8% contract CNAs, facilities at the 50th percentile employed 5.9%, and facilities at the 80th percentile employed 5.7%—all remarkably similar to the overall sample mean of 5.9%. This uniformity across the size distribution provided no evidence for the hypothesized inverted-U pattern in which mid-sized facilities would show elevated contract labor use.

**For manuscript Discussion section (Interpretation):**

The absence of an inverted-U pattern in contract CNA reliance by facility size challenges theoretical predictions derived from Transaction Cost Economics. The hypothesis suggested that mid-sized facilities—too large to operate with purely flexible staffing but too small to leverage administrative economies of scale—would face unique pressures driving contract labor reliance. Empirically, this predicted pattern did not materialize. Instead, contract labor use was uniformly distributed across the size spectrum and explained primarily by geographic factors.

Several explanations merit consideration. First, if contract labor use serves regulatory compliance or operational flexibility functions that are independent of facility size, then we would expect flat relationships across the size distribution, which is precisely what was observed. Facilities at all sizes might use contract labor episodically to manage vacation coverage, sick leave, staffing shortages, or temporary census increases, with contract labor representing a standard operational tool rather than a size-dependent strategy. Second, the low median contract labor use (1.9% across all facilities) suggests that contract labor is supplementary rather than central to staffing strategy for most facilities. Under this interpretation, the distinction between small and large facilities is not whether they use contract labor but rather the degree to which they rely on it—a continuous variation that may be driven by factors other than size (such as turnover rates, recruitment success, or workforce stability). Third, larger facilities may have developed sophisticated workforce planning that minimizes contract labor use despite potential availability of temporary workers, while smaller facilities that successfully recruit and retain staff may also minimize contract labor. If organizational management quality and workforce culture—rather than organizational size—predict contract labor avoidance, then size-independent relationships emerge.

The dominance of state effects in explaining contract CNA use (11 times greater than size effects) points toward regulatory, labor supply, and regional factors as primary drivers. States with higher contract CNA proportions may face specific conditions (e.g., RN shortages making permanent CNA recruitment competitive, state regulations permitting flexible staffing arrangements, high cost of living increasing turnover) that differ from states with lower contract CNA proportions. Future research should investigate the specific state-level factors explaining this 0.177-unit range (Vermont 10.9% to Arkansas approximately 3.2%), as such investigation could yield actionable policy insights.

## Finding 6: Geographic and State Variation Dominates Size Effects

**For manuscript Results section:**

A striking pattern emerged when comparing the magnitude of facility size effects versus geographic (state) effects. In the contract CNA model, state fixed effects increased the model R² from 0.01 (size effects only) to 0.12 (size effects plus state effects), representing an 11-fold increase in explained variance. This pattern indicates that geographic factors—including state regulatory environments, labor supply conditions, cost of living, and regional healthcare system structures—exercise substantially greater influence on contract labor use than facility size. Examination of state-specific fixed effects revealed substantial variation: Vermont facilities reported contract CNA proportions approximately 0.109 units above the national mean, while Arkansas facilities reported proportions approximately 0.067 units below the national mean. This 0.177-unit range (roughly 3 times the national mean of 5.9%) demonstrates the magnitude of geographic variation in contract labor strategies.

Similar patterns emerged in the RN-to-LPN ratio analysis, where state fixed effects notably increased model R² relative to size-only specifications, indicating that state-level factors substantially influence the portion of staffing devoted to RNs versus LPNs. These state effects likely reflect multiple dimensions: state minimum staffing regulations (which vary in RN requirements), Medicaid reimbursement rates (which vary by state and directly influence facility revenue and staffing capacity), nursing education pipeline development (which shapes the supply of RNs and LPNs available to facilities), and regional wage structures (which influence the relative cost of RN versus LPN labor). The prominence of geographic factors suggests that understanding nursing home staffing requires attention to contextual factors largely outside individual facility control—factors that determine the range of choices available to facility managers rather than how facilities optimize within those choices.

## Finding 7: Sensitivity Analyses and Robustness

**For manuscript Results and Methods sections:**

All primary findings demonstrated robust stability across alternative model specifications, varying outlier exclusion thresholds, and different minimum facility size criteria. In the RN-to-LPN ratio analysis, the core finding—negative association between facility size and RN-to-LPN ratio—remained statistically significant (p < 0.05) across all sensitivity scenarios: outlier thresholds ranging from |z-score| > 4.0 to |z-score| > 3.0, minimum facility census thresholds ranging from 20 to 50 residents per day, and the quadratic model specification testing for non-linear size effects. The consistency of statistical significance and the stability of coefficient magnitudes across these variations provide confidence that the negative relationship reflects a genuine systematic pattern rather than an artifact of outlier handling or sample composition.

Similarly, the non-significant association between facility size (linear or quadratic) and contract CNA proportions remained non-significant across all sensitivity specifications, confirming the absence of the hypothesized inverted-U pattern. The contrast in robustness between these two findings—the robust negative association for RN-to-LPN ratio versus the robust null finding for contract CNA proportions—reinforces their divergent implications: RN-to-LPN ratio relationships with size represent stable empirical patterns worthy of explanation and discussion, while contract CNA relationships with size show genuine absence of association rather than measurement instability.

This sensitivity analysis strengthens the study's conclusions by demonstrating that the main findings are not dependent on specific analytical choices regarding outlier exclusion or sample composition. In the context of large national datasets where small numbers of extreme values might influence results, this robustness verification is essential for establishing credibility.

## Finding 8: Correlations Between Facility Size and Component Staffing Types

**For manuscript Results section (contextual finding):**

Facility size showed differentiated correlations with different staffing categories, providing insight into how staffing scales with facility size. Certified Nursing Assistant hours per resident day showed the strongest correlation with facility size (r = 0.887), indicating that CNA staffing scales nearly proportionally with facility resident populations. Licensed Practical Nurse hours per resident day showed a substantial though somewhat weaker correlation (r = 0.811), indicating that LPN staffing also tracks closely with facility size but with somewhat greater variation. Registered Nurse hours per resident day showed a notably weaker correlation with facility size (r = 0.539), suggesting that RN staffing is more discretionary than CNA or LPN staffing, with greater variation in deployment across similarly-sized facilities. This pattern of decreasing correlations from CNA to LPN to RN staffing aligns with the hypothesis that RN deployment is discretionary (driven by management choice, regulatory variation, and facility-specific circumstances) while CNA and LPN staffing are more directly tied to resident care needs.

The weak negative correlation between facility size and RN-to-LPN ratio (r = -0.030) contrasted sharply with the very strong positive correlations between size and absolute staffing hours. This pattern indicates that while larger facilities employ more total staff—including more absolute RN hours—they employ proportionally fewer RNs relative to LPNs. Larger facilities scale up their total nursing workforce with their resident population but shift the composition toward LPNs. This suggests a consistent staffing strategy applied across facility sizes (scaling staff with census) combined with a composition strategy that favors LPNs in larger facilities.

## Summary: Unified Interpretation Framework

Across all findings, a coherent narrative emerges: nursing home staffing levels scale proportionally with facility size and resident census (strong correlations ranging from r = 0.539 to r = 0.887), but staffing composition (RN-to-LPN ratio) shows little relationship to size and may decline with size (r = -0.030, regression coefficient = -0.007, p = 0.005). Contract labor use shows no relationship to facility size. These patterns suggest that staffing at nursing homes reflects standardized care models (constant staffing ratio per resident) applied uniformly across facility sizes, with composition determined by factors other than size (state regulation, labor supply, management preferences). This interpretation challenges Transaction Cost Economics predictions while aligning with alternative frameworks emphasizing regulatory constraints and labor market conditions as primary drivers of staffing patterns.
