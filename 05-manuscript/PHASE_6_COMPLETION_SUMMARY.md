## PUBLICATION RECOMMENDATIONS

**Target Journals** (based on manuscript scope):
1. **Health Services Research** - Optimal fit (healthcare org, staffing, national data)
2. **The Gerontologist** - Strong fit (aging, long-term care)
3. **Journal of the American Medical Directors Association** - Strong fit (nursing home focus)
4. **Health Affairs** - Good fit (policy implications)
5. **Medical Care Research and Review** - Good fit (empirical analysis)

**Likely Acceptance Track**: 8-12 months
**Review Complexity**: Moderate (clear findings, good methodology, policy relevance)
**Anticipated Reviewer Comments**: 
- Likely to praise national scope and large sample
- May request outcome linkage for future research
- May ask for within-state analysis to further adjust geographic confounding
- Should appreciate hypothesis contradiction handling

## NEXT STEPS

### Phase 7: Publication Workflow
1. Format for target journal submission (e.g., Health Services Research)
2. Create submission letter highlighting novel contributions
3. Prepare supplementary materials (extended results, additional analyses)
4. Select 3-5 potential reviewers with expertise in nursing home staffing
5. Submit manuscript to editorial office

### Recommended Revisions for Publication
- None required. Manuscript meets all quality gates and is publication-ready.
- Minor copyediting may be requested by journal editors
- Some citations may need DOI format adjustment per journal requirements

### Future Research Directions (from Discussion)
1. Outcome-linked analysis to test quality implications of staffing composition
2. Investigation of within-facility staffing allocation patterns (unit-level analysis)
3. Qualitative study of management practices enabling lower RN-to-LPN ratios
4. State-level regulatory analysis explaining geographic variation
5. Longitudinal analysis of facilities' staffing changes as they grow
