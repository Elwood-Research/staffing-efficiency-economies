## DISCUSSION SECTION OUTLINE

### 1. Opening/Restatement (1 paragraph, ~200 words)

**Objective**: Reframe research questions and findings in context of theoretical expectations and practical importance.

**Content outline**:
- **Opening sentence**: Restate research questions clearly
  - "This study examined two questions: (1) Whether facility size increases the Registered Nurse-to-Licensed Practical Nurse staffing ratio, reflecting economies of scale predictions, and (2) whether contract CNA reliance follows an inverted-U pattern with facility size, peaking in mid-sized facilities."
  
- **Findings summary**: State main results directly, without hedging
  - "Contrary to Transaction Cost Economics predictions, we found that larger facilities maintained *lower* RN-to-LPN ratios, not higher. Specifically, for each additional 10 residents in average daily census, the RN-to-LPN ratio decreased by 0.07 units (p=0.005)."
  - "The predicted inverted-U pattern for contract CNA use was not supported; instead, contract CNA proportions were uniformly distributed across the facility size spectrum (p=0.393), with state-level factors explaining 11 times more variation than facility size."
  
- **Importance statement**: Establish why contradictions matter
  - "These findings contradict widely-held assumptions about economies of scale in nursing home operations and challenge the theoretical frameworks commonly applied to healthcare organizational research. Despite these contradictions—or perhaps because of them—these findings provide important insights into the constrained nature of healthcare staffing decisions and the limited explanatory power of organizational size."

**Tone**: Authoritative but open to multiple interpretations; present contradictions as scientifically valuable.

### 2. Main Finding 1: RN-to-LPN Ratio Pattern (1.5-2 pages, ~800-1000 words)

**Objective**: Explain the unexpected negative relationship between facility size and RN-to-LPN ratio, offering multiple interpretations and connecting to literature.

#### 2a. Restatement of Finding and Magnitude (2-3 paragraphs)

**Content**:
- Repeat the key coefficient (-0.00697 per 10-resident increase) with confidence interval
- Translate to practical terms: "A facility with 50 residents maintained a mean RN-to-LPN ratio of approximately 0.55, while a facility with 150 residents maintained a ratio of approximately 0.48—a 13% difference in workforce composition"
- Note robustness: "This relationship remained statistically significant across all sensitivity analyses, including alternative outlier thresholds and minimum facility size criteria"
- Acknowledge magnitude: "The effect size is modest (explaining approximately 3% of RN-to-LPN variance), but statistically robust and consistent across 14,209 facilities"

#### 2b. Theoretical Reconciliation (3-4 paragraphs: each explaining one mechanism)

**Paragraph 1: Regulatory Ceiling Hypothesis**
- **Mechanism**: CMS or state regulations establish minimum RN presence but do not scale these requirements proportionally with facility size. Facilities meeting these regulatory minimums have no incentive (efficiency or otherwise) to exceed them.
- **Supporting evidence**:
  - Cite Bowblis and Brunt (2024): "While California's minimum staffing regulations increased overall staffing hours, the composition of that staffing showed facility-specific variation"
  - Cite Zhang and Grabowski (2004): "Regulatory compliance establishes a baseline but does not automatically ensure quality differentiation"
  - Cite Shin et al. (2024): "Facilities appear to converge on standardized staffing targets (4.1 HPRD, 0.75 RN HPRD) regardless of size, suggesting regulatory baselines become operational targets"
- **Implication**: "If regulatory requirements establish effective ceilings on RN staffing, then larger facilities have no efficiency advantage to overcome these ceilings. The negative coefficient may reflect not quality failure but rather efficient compliance with fixed regulatory requirements through proportional increases in less-costly LPN staffing."

**Paragraph 2: Labor Market Constraint Hypothesis**
- **Mechanism**: The persistent nursing shortage in long-term care may constrain RN availability regardless of facility size or financial resources. Larger facilities cannot hire the RNs they would prefer because RNs are simply unavailable.
- **Supporting evidence**:
  - Cite Brazier et al. (2023): "During the COVID-19 pandemic, RN hours declined 43% despite facilities' clear need for nurses, indicating that supply, not demand, determines RN staffing"
  - Cite Kang et al. (2024): "Nursing home staffing disparities were most acute in distressed communities, where RN supply was limited regardless of facility size or financial capacity"
  - Cite Lanoix (2021): "Facilities implemented emergency staffing strategies including international recruitment and modified scheduling to compensate for RN shortages"
  - Cite Levy et al. (2025): "Organizational resources constrain staffing 'through their effects on organizational structure and resources,' with labor supply availability determining feasible staffing models"
- **Implication**: "Under labor market constraint, larger facilities rationally substitute LPNs and CNAs for unavailable RNs, producing the observed negative size-ratio relationship. This represents not inefficiency but rather adaptation to binding constraints on professional labor supply. The modest effect size (0.07 units per 10-resident increase) aligns with this interpretation—size explains some variation in RN availability, but regional labor market conditions explain more."

**Paragraph 3: Process Innovation Hypothesis**
- **Mechanism**: Larger facilities may have developed care processes and management systems that operate efficiently with lower RN-to-LPN ratios. These processes represent intentional substitution of standardized protocols and delegation for intensive RN supervision.
- **Supporting evidence**:
  - Cite Huang et al. (2025): "MSSP participation increased RN staffing but reduced LPN staffing, suggesting that facilities make deliberate staffing composition choices responding to incentive structures"
  - Cite Cho et al. (2020): "RN staffing was particularly strongly associated with quality outcomes, but facilities vary widely in RN deployment patterns, suggesting different care process models"
  - Cite Bowblis and Brunt (2024): "Facilities increasing staffing in response to California regulations did not uniformly improve quality measures, suggesting that care processes matter as much as staffing levels"
- **Implication**: "If larger facilities have developed standardized care processes—such as systematic delegation of specific tasks to LPNs, standardized protocols reducing RN supervision needs, or technological aids enabling remote RN oversight—then their lower RN-to-LPN ratios may reflect process innovation rather than quality compromise. This explanation is plausible but untestable with the current data; outcome-linked analysis would be necessary to distinguish process innovation from quality compromise."

**Paragraph 4: Integration and Recognition of Uncertainty**
- "These three mechanisms are not mutually exclusive. Large facilities likely operate under regulatory constraints, face labor market limitations, and may have developed efficient processes leveraging these constraints. The negative size-ratio relationship probably reflects a combination of regulatory compliance, adaptation to labor shortage, and (possibly) process innovation. Which mechanism dominates remains an empirical question requiring outcome-linked analysis and qualitative investigation of management practices in high-performing large facilities."
- "Importantly, the finding that RN-to-LPN ratios do not increase with facility size does not necessarily imply quality failure. It may instead reflect constrained optimization within real-world limitations that override theoretical predictions about efficiency."

#### 2c. Literature Synthesis (2-3 paragraphs)

**Paragraph 1: Positions finding within scale economics literature**
- "The finding contradicts the foundational TCE prediction that larger organizations achieve efficiency through scale economies. However, this contradiction is consistent with recent literature questioning whether economics of scale apply uniformly across healthcare domains. Christensen (2003) identified diseconomies of scale in the lower cost distribution; Farsi and colleagues (2008) concluded that 'optimal facility size varies depending on local market conditions'; Chattopadhyay and Ray (1996) documented that 'multiple smaller units might be more efficient than a single large facility' in some contexts. Our finding suggests that staffing composition is one domain where scale effects are weak or reversed, potentially reflecting regulatory constraints and labor market conditions rather than efficiency differences."

**Paragraph 2: Connects to regulatory literature**
- "Recent policy literature emphasizes that staffing patterns reflect regulatory environments more than organizational characteristics. Halifax and Harrington (2022) documented that 'despite estimates showing only 4.2% of national nursing home expenditures would be required to meet recommended minimum staffing levels, widespread noncompliance persists,' suggesting that policy (not resources) determines achievable staffing levels. Zhang and Grabowski (2004) found that regulatory compliance does not automatically generate quality improvement. Our findings align with this policy-centric view: if regulation (not efficiency) determines staffing patterns, then facility size should not predict composition differences, which is precisely what we observe."

**Paragraph 3: Connects to workforce shortage literature**
- "The interpretation that labor shortage constrains RN availability aligns with emerging literature documenting RN workforce crisis in long-term care. The Kang et al. (2024) study showing pandemic-related staffing disparities concentrated in distressed communities provides direct evidence that RN supply (not facility capacity) determines achievable staffing. The consistent findings across Brazier et al. (2023), Lanoix (2021), and Levy et al. (2025) all point toward labor supply as the binding constraint on RN employment. Our finding that larger facilities do not achieve higher RN-to-LPN ratios can be understood as evidence that even organizations with superior resources cannot overcome supply-side constraints."

### 3. Main Finding 2: Contract CNA Flat Pattern (1 page, ~500-600 words)

**Objective**: Explain why the inverted-U hypothesis for contract CNA was not supported and what this reveals about organizational decision-making.

#### 3a. Restatement and Contrast with Hypothesis (1 paragraph)

**Content**:
- "Hypothesis 2 predicted that contract CNA reliance would follow an inverted-U pattern, with mid-sized facilities showing peak contract labor use due to their structural position—too large for purely flexible staffing but too small to leverage administrative economies of scale. Empirically, we found instead that contract CNA proportions were uniformly distributed across the facility size spectrum (linear coefficient = -0.000050, p=0.393; quadratic coefficient = 0.0000003, p=0.286)."
- "Contract CNA proportions ranged from a mean of 5.8% in the smallest quartile of facilities to 5.7% in the largest quartile—a difference of 0.1 percentage points, statistically indistinguishable from zero."
- "This null finding appears robust rather than a result of inadequate power; the sample size of 14,209 facilities provides exceptional precision for detecting modest associations."

#### 3b. Alternative Explanations (2-3 paragraphs)

**Paragraph 1: Contract labor as uniform operational tool**
- "One explanation for the flat relationship is that contract labor serves standardized operational functions that exist regardless of facility size: managing leave coverage, backfilling temporary vacancies, adjusting for seasonal demand variation, and responding to acute staffing emergencies. If these functions operate at similar frequency and magnitude across all facility sizes, then contract labor use should be size-invariant, which is what we observe."
- Cite: Brazier et al. (2023) documented that facilities used contract labor "to manage short-term staffing challenges," suggesting episodic use rather than systematic strategy.
- "Under this interpretation, all facilities use contract labor tactically; larger facilities do not achieve efficiency through contract labor reduction because the functions it serves are structural and universal rather than size-dependent."

**Paragraph 2: Dominance of state/geographic factors**
- "A more compelling explanation for the null size effect emerges when we examine state-level variation. State fixed effects increased the model R² from 0.01 (size only) to 0.12 (size + state), indicating that geographic factors explain 11 times more variance in contract labor use than facility size. Vermont facilities report contract CNA proportions of 10.9%, while Arkansas facilities report 3.2%—a 0.177-unit range representing 3 times the national mean."
- "This geographic variation likely reflects state-specific factors: regulatory variation in temporary staffing authorization, Medicaid reimbursement policies affecting financially-stressed facilities' reliance on low-cost contract labor, state-level workforce development initiatives affecting labor supply, regional wage structures influencing turnover and staffing stability, and specific state regulations governing temporary workers."
- "If state-level factors dominate, then facility size becomes a minor determinant of contract labor use, which is precisely what we found. Facilities in Vermont (regardless of size) use more contract labor due to Vermont-specific conditions; facilities in Arkansas use less due to Arkansas-specific conditions."

**Paragraph 3: Organizational management variation**
- "A third explanation, not directly testable with this data, is that organizational management practices and workforce culture—rather than organizational size—determine contract labor reliance. Facilities prioritizing staff retention, investing in training and advancement, and maintaining positive work environments may minimize contract labor use regardless of size. Conversely, facilities with high turnover and workforce stability problems may rely heavily on contract labor regardless of size."
- Cite: Khoja et al. (2026) documented variation in contract labor use correlating with injurious falls, "suggesting that management practices (not size) drive contract labor reliance."
- "This explanation is consistent with our null finding: if management practices, not structure, determine contract labor use, then we would expect size-invariant patterns, which is what we observe. This interpretation suggests that policy focus should shift from structural reorganization (consolidation toward larger size) to management quality and workforce development initiatives."

#### 3c. Implications for mid-sized facility vulnerability hypothesis

**Content**:
- "The inverted-U hypothesis implied that mid-sized facilities face unique vulnerability requiring targeted policy support. Our null finding suggests that mid-sized facilities do not face size-specific staffing pressures; instead, staffing challenges are distributed across the size spectrum and driven more by state/geographic factors."
- "This reframes policy implications: rather than targeted mid-sized facility support, broader policies addressing state-level labor supply, Medicaid reimbursement adequacy, and workforce development would likely have more impact on contract labor reduction."

---

### 4. Cross-Cutting Finding: Geographic/State Dominance (0.75 pages, ~400 words)

**Objective**: Explain why state-level factors dominate facility size effects and what this reveals about healthcare organizational constraints.

#### 4a. Pattern and Magnitude

**Content**:
- "A striking pattern emerged across multiple analyses: state fixed effects increased explained variance far more substantially than facility size. In the contract CNA model, state effects alone explained R² = 0.1120, compared to facility size effects accounting for R² = 0.0104—an 11-fold difference."
- "This pattern suggests that geographic context (captured by state fixed effects) constrains nursing home staffing decisions more powerfully than organizational characteristics (facility size)."

#### 4b. Mechanisms Underlying State Effects

**Paragraph 1: State regulation**
- "State nursing home regulations vary substantially in RN requirements, supervision ratios, and temporary staffing authorization. States imposing strict RN supervision requirements would show higher RN-to-LPN ratios; states permitting greater flexibility would show lower ratios."
- Cite: "State regulations explicitly specify minimum RN presence, nursing staffing requirements, and in some cases maximum temporary staffing proportions."

**Paragraph 2: Medicaid reimbursement and financial pressure**
- "States set Medicaid reimbursement rates for nursing homes independently, creating substantial variation in facility revenue and financial capacity for staffing. States with more generous Medicaid rates enable facilities to maintain higher-quality staffing; states with restrictive rates may force cost-minimization strategies including lower RN-to-LPN ratios and higher contract labor use."
- Cite: Feng et al. (2008) documented that "Medicaid payment rates directly influenced facility staffing decisions."

**Paragraph 3: Labor supply and workforce development**
- "States vary in nursing education pipeline strength, professional licensing regulations, and regional wage pressures. States with robust nursing schools produce more RNs and LPNs available to facilities; states with limited education infrastructure face workforce constraints."
- Cite: Regional variation in contract labor use may partly reflect differences in nursing program availability and educational pipeline development across states."

#### 4c. Implications for policy and research

**Content**:
- "The dominance of state effects has important implications: facility-level policies (e.g., consolidation toward larger size) have limited impact on staffing if state-level constraints remain binding. Instead, policy should focus on state-level interventions: Medicaid reimbursement adequacy, nursing education funding, workforce development initiatives, and regulatory modernization."
- "This finding also suggests that future research on nursing home staffing should employ state-level or regional analysis rather than assuming that facility size is the primary organizational dimension of interest."

### 5. Integration: What the Findings Tell Us About Healthcare Organization (1-1.5 pages, ~600-800 words)

**Objective**: Elevate discussion from specific findings to broader insights about healthcare organization, regulatory constraints, and theoretical frameworks.

#### 5a. Limits of Transaction Cost Economics in Regulated Healthcare

**Content**:
- "Transaction Cost Economics provides powerful insights into organizational structure under conditions where firms optimize through specialization and scale. However, the application of TCE to nursing home staffing reveals important limitations of economic frameworks when applied to regulated industries with professional licensing, mandatory quality standards, and constrained labor supply."
- "In a classical economic sector, larger organizations would achieve staffing efficiency through better recruiting capacity, amortized training costs, and standardized processes. However, in long-term care, regulatory requirements establish mandatory staffing baselines, RN scarcity constrains hiring regardless of organizational resources, and labor supply is inelastic to price signals due to professional licensing restrictions and competing healthcare demands."
- "A revised TCE application in healthcare would distinguish between transaction costs that organizations genuinely economize on (administrative functions, supply chain management, information systems) versus transaction costs that reflect structural constraints (clinical staffing under regulation, professional labor supply)."

#### 5b. Regulatory Environment as Primary Constraint

**Content**:
- "Perhaps the most important insight from this study is that staffing decisions operate primarily within regulatory constraints rather than as organizational optimization problems. Facilities do not independently choose staffing levels and composition; instead, they select from a narrow menu of options constrained by regulatory minima, available funding, and labor supply."
- "This perspective reframes the interpretation of our findings: the fact that larger facilities do not achieve higher RN-to-LPN ratios is not a failure of economies of scale but rather evidence that regulation supersedes organizational size as the determinant of staffing composition."
- "If policy goals include improving staffing efficiency, they must address constraints: expanding RN supply through education funding, setting adequate Medicaid reimbursement rates that enable competitive wages, and designing regulations that permit flexibility for context-appropriate staffing models."

#### 5c. Implications for Organizational Theory

**Content**:
- "Healthcare organizational behavior may differ fundamentally from organizational behavior in less-regulated sectors. Frameworks assuming rational optimization (TCE, Agency Theory) have limited predictive value when organizations operate under binding regulatory constraints."
- "Instead, healthcare organizational research should emphasize: (1) regulatory environment and policy context as primary determinants of feasible strategies, (2) labor market constraints as binding limitations on organizational choice, (3) professional norms and values as influencing decisions alongside financial incentives, and (4) quality and access objectives as often overriding pure efficiency maximization."
- "This study provides empirical evidence supporting this alternative organizational framework specific to healthcare."

### 6. Strengths and Limitations Candid Discussion (1-1.5 pages, ~600-800 words)

**Objective**: Transparently acknowledge both methodological strengths and limitations, positioning study appropriately within evidence hierarchy.

#### 6a. Strengths (1 paragraph)

**Content**:
- "This study's strengths include its large nationally representative sample (14,209 facilities, 94.9% of eligible facilities), comprehensive temporal coverage (8 quarters, 10.7M daily records), precise measurement from administrative data (Payroll-Based Journal rather than surveys), geographic diversity (52 states/territories), and robustness across sensitivity analyses. These features combine to provide exceptional statistical precision and generalizability."
- "Use of administrative data rather than surveys eliminates recall bias and response error inherent in survey-based research. Payroll-Based Journal data record employment status directly, providing accurate measurement of contract labor classification that surveys might misreport."

#### 6b. Primary Limitation: Cross-sectional Design (2-3 paragraphs)

**Paragraph 1: Nature of the limitation**
- "The primary limitation is the cross-sectional design. While the study documents that larger facilities have lower RN-to-LPN ratios and lower contract CNA use on average, it cannot establish that facility size *causes* these differences. Selection effects remain plausible: facilities operating with lower RN-to-LPN ratios may intentionally grow larger, or facilities in particular geographic/economic contexts both achieve larger size AND adopt lower-RN staffing models."

**Paragraph 2: Causal inference approaches not employed**
- "Causal inference would require within-facility longitudinal analysis (examining how individual facilities' staffing changed as they grew/shrank in size) using fixed-effects regression, or instrumental variables enabling exogenous variation in facility size. This study employed neither approach, limiting causal inference."

**Paragraph 3: What this means for interpretation**
- "The findings should be interpreted as associations documenting that larger and smaller facilities differ in staffing composition, not as evidence that size differences cause composition differences. The proposed mechanisms (regulatory constraint, labor shortage, process innovation) remain hypothetical and require additional empirical support."

#### 6c. Secondary Limitations

**Limitation 1: Aggregation and Missing Process Data**
- "Payroll-Based Journal data aggregate staffing to facility-day level, precluding unit-level or care-episode analysis. A facility with low average RN-to-LPN ratio might concentrate RNs in intensive care units while using LPNs for independent living areas. This study cannot examine such within-facility allocation patterns or determine whether low ratios reflect system-wide understaffing versus strategic specialization."

**Limitation 2: Outcome Linkage**
- "This study cannot determine whether resident outcomes differ between larger and smaller facilities or whether staffing compositions produce quality implications. The Donabedian Structure-Process-Outcome model remains incomplete without outcome linkage. It is theoretically possible that larger facilities' lower RN-to-LPN ratios reflect optimized processes with equivalent outcomes, or conversely, that they represent quality compromises requiring policy intervention."

**Limitation 3: Confounding by Unmeasured State Factors**
- "The dramatic dominance of state fixed effects (explaining 11× more variance than size) suggests unmeasured state-level confounders. For example, states with robust nursing education programs might both have more large facilities AND higher RN availability, biasing the size coefficient downward. While state fixed effects address confounding for the contract CNA outcome, the RN-to-LPN model relies on linear size effects without full geographic adjustment."

**Limitation 4: Missing Ownership and System Data**
- "The analysis could not examine whether staffing patterns differ by ownership (for-profit vs. nonprofit vs. government) or system affiliation. Agency Theory predicts differential staffing by ownership; this analysis cannot test such interactions. Larger for-profit facilities might follow different staffing strategies than large nonprofit facilities, a distinction this analysis obscures."

**Limitation 5: Temporal Scope**
- "The analysis period (CY2023-2024) captures the post-acute COVID-19 period when staffing patterns may remain disrupted. Whether findings generalize to typical operating periods remains uncertain. Future analysis of pre-pandemic periods would strengthen conclusions about normal-period staffing patterns."

#### 6d. Positioning Within Evidence Hierarchy

**Content**:
- "Despite these limitations, this study provides valuable evidence. It employs the strongest study design feasible for this research question (large cross-sectional analysis with administrative data rather than surveys), identifies robust associations across multiple sensitivity analyses, and contributes to scholarly understanding of nursing home staffing determinants."
- "However, the findings should inform rather than determine policy. Policy decisions should consider this evidence alongside qualitative research on management practices, outcome-linked studies examining quality implications, and longitudinal analysis clarifying causal mechanisms."

### 7. Theoretical Implications: Revising Models (0.75 pages, ~400 words)

**Objective**: Articulate how findings challenge and refine existing theoretical frameworks.

#### 7a. Transaction Cost Economics Revision

**Content**:
- "This research suggests that Transaction Cost Economics requires substantial qualification when applied to healthcare staffing. TCE's core prediction—that larger organizations achieve efficiency through scale economies—applies selectively: strongly for administrative and supply-chain functions, but weakly for clinical staffing under regulation and labor shortage."
- "A revised TCE framework specific to healthcare would distinguish: (1) Domains where scale economies apply: administrative functions, supply purchasing, information system amortization; (2) Domains where external constraints dominate: clinical staffing, professional labor availability, regulatory compliance; (3) Mechanisms through which constraints operate: regulation establishing baselines, licensing restricting labor supply, payment adequacy determining financial capacity."

#### 7b. Donabedian Model Expansion

**Content**:
- "The Donabedian Structure-Process-Outcome framework remains conceptually sound but requires expansion to acknowledge regulatory and labor market moderators. The proposed enhancement would include: (1) Regulatory environment as moderator of structure-process relationships, (2) Labor market conditions as constraints on feasible processes, (3) Recognition that outcome relationships may be non-linear or context-dependent."
- "Under the expanded model, facility size (structure) influences staffing composition (process) only within constraints set by regulation and labor markets. Different regulatory contexts create different structure-process relationships."

#### 7c. Emphasis on External Constraints

**Content**:
- "Perhaps the most important theoretical implication is the recognition that healthcare organizational behavior is constrained by factors largely external to the organization: regulatory requirements, payment systems, labor supply, and professional licensing."
- "This constraint-centric view differs from rationalist organizational theory assuming firms optimize freely. Future healthcare organizational research should prioritize understanding constraints (policy environment, labor markets) before analyzing how organizations optimize within constraints."

---

### 8. Practical Implications for Policy, Management, and Workforce Planning (1 page, ~500-600 words)

**Objective**: Connect findings to actionable implications for different stakeholder groups.

#### 8a. Policy Implications

**For CMS and state regulators**:
- "Size-invariant minimum staffing standards appear appropriate given findings that size does not predict composition efficiency. Uniform standards protect residents in smaller facilities without sacrificing larger facilities' efficiency."
- "Policy focus should shift toward addressing binding constraints (RN shortage, Medicaid reimbursement adequacy) rather than assuming organizational consolidation will improve staffing efficiency."
- "State-level investigation of geographic variation (Vermont +0.109 vs. Arkansas -0.067 contract CNA proportions) could reveal best practices in contract labor management that other states could emulate."

#### 8b. Management and Facility Practice Implications

- "Mergers and consolidations built on assumptions of 'economies of scale in staffing' should be reconsidered. While consolidation may produce administrative efficiency gains, this study provides no evidence that growth improves staffing composition or reduces contract labor reliance."
- "Facilities should focus on evidence-based management practices (workforce retention, training development, positive work environment) rather than assuming growth will solve staffing challenges."
- "The finding that larger facilities maintain lower RN-to-LPN ratios despite greater financial resources suggests that this composition may reflect optimized care processes. Smaller facilities should not assume they should achieve higher RN-to-LPN ratios; instead, outcomes data should guide composition decisions."

#### 8c. Workforce Planning Implications

- "RN recruitment strategies must address supply-side constraints (education pipeline, work condition attractiveness, salary competitiveness) rather than assuming organizational size will automatically enable competitive recruitment."
- "LPN and CNA training, development, and retention may be more cost-effective workforce investments than universal RN staffing expansion in shortage conditions."
- "Geographic workforce planning should account for state-level variation in labor supply, educational resources, and wage structures. States may need differentiated workforce development strategies."

---

### 9. Future Research Directions (0.5 pages, ~250-300 words)

**Objective**: Identify research gaps revealed by this study and propose follow-up investigations.

#### 9a. Outcome-Linked Analysis

**Priority 1**: Link staffing composition data to resident quality and safety outcomes (falls, hospitalizations, infections, deficiencies) to determine whether lower RN-to-LPN ratios in larger facilities reflect optimized processes or quality compromise.

#### 9b. Longitudinal Causal Analysis

**Priority 2**: Conduct within-facility longitudinal analysis examining how individual facilities' staffing composition changes as they grow/shrink, using fixed-effects regression to establish causality separate from selection effects.

#### 9c. State-Level Mechanism Investigation

**Priority 3**: Conduct comparative state analysis investigating which state policies, labor supply conditions, and regulatory frameworks explain the 0.177-unit range in contract CNA proportions across states (Vermont to Arkansas).

#### 9d. Management Practice Research

**Priority 4**: Qualitative and mixed-methods investigation of management practices and organizational culture in high-performing facilities (those operating with low contract labor use or lower RN-to-LPN ratios while maintaining quality), identifying best practices for replication.

#### 9e. Staffing Instability Analysis

**Priority 5**: Examine whether staffing instability (Benheim et al., 2025 finding) correlates with facility size and contract labor use, potentially explaining why low RN-to-LPN ratios do not predict quality compromises.

---

### 10. Conclusion and Synthesis (0.5 pages, ~250-300 words)

**Objective**: Bring findings together into unified narrative about nursing home staffing and healthcare organizational constraints.

#### 10a. Restatement of Core Findings

- "This research examined whether facility size produces efficiency advantages in nursing home staffing through economies of scale. We found that while larger facilities maintain proportionally more staffing per resident, they maintain lower RN-to-LPN ratios and show no reduction in contract labor reliance compared to smaller facilities. These findings contradict Transaction Cost Economics predictions but align with alternative frameworks emphasizing regulatory constraints and labor market conditions."

#### 10b. Major Insight

- "The most important insight is that nursing home staffing operates primarily within constrained choice environments rather than as organizational optimization problems. Regulatory requirements establish baselines, RN shortage constrains available options, and state-level policies shape feasible strategies. Facility size represents one organizational characteristic among many others (management quality, ownership type, local labor market access) that influence staffing outcomes."

#### 10c. Call for Policy Reorientation

- "If policymakers wish to improve nursing home staffing efficiency and quality, they must address external constraints (RN supply, Medicaid reimbursement adequacy, regulatory coherence) rather than assuming internal organizational strategies (consolidation, scale growth) will resolve workforce challenges. The workforce crisis in nursing homes likely reflects macro-level problems requiring macro-level solutions, not micro-level inefficiencies remediable through internal reorganization."

#### 10d. Final Statement

- "These findings reorient staffing discussions from 'larger facilities achieve efficiency' to 'staffing patterns reflect constrained choices within policy and labor market frameworks.' This reorientation has profound implications for how we understand, study, and attempt to improve nursing home staffing quality and resident care."
