FIGURES EMBEDDED IN PRESENTATION
================================================================================

FIGURE 1: Facility Size Histogram (Slide 5)
  File: figure1a_census_histogram.png (109 KB)
  Description: Distribution of daily resident census across 14,209 facilities
  Quality: 300 DPI equivalent, PNG format
  Integration: Demonstrates sample diversity

FIGURE 2: H1 Results - Spline Fit (Slide 6)
  File: figure2_h1_spline_fit.png (145 KB)
  Description: RN-to-LPN ratio vs. facility size with spline curve
  Quality: Includes 95% CI band and decile means
  Integration: Visually demonstrates negative relationship (hypothesis contradiction)

FIGURE 3: H2 Results - Flat Pattern (Slide 7)
  File: figure3_h2_spline_fit.png (170 KB)
  Description: Contract CNA proportion vs. facility size
  Quality: Shows flat relationship (no inverted-U)

SUPPLEMENTARY FIGURES (Available for extended presentation):
  • figure1b_rn_to_lpn_histogram.png (114 KB)
  • figure1c_contract_cna_histogram.png (122 KB)
  • strobe_diagram.png (501 KB) - Selection process flow

================================================================================
ANALYSIS FINDINGS ADDRESSED
================================================================================

HYPOTHESIS 1 (RN-to-LPN Ratio):
  Prediction: Ratio increases with facility size (Transaction Cost Economics)
  Finding: ❌ CONTRADICTED - Ratio DECREASES with facility size
  Evidence: β = -0.00697 per 10-resident increase (p = 0.005)
  Interpretation: Larger facilities employ proportionally MORE LPNs relative to RNs
  Status: CLEARLY ADDRESSED IN SLIDES 6, 9

HYPOTHESIS 2 (Contract CNA Proportion):
  Prediction: Inverted-U relationship (mid-size vulnerability)
  Finding: ❌ NOT SUPPORTED - Flat relationship
  Evidence: Linear p = 0.393, Quadratic p = 0.286
  Interpretation: Facility size does NOT determine contract labor reliance
  Status: CLEARLY ADDRESSED IN SLIDES 7, 9

UNEXPECTED FINDING (State/Geographic Dominance):
  Discovery: State fixed effects explain 11x more variance than facility size
  Mechanism: Medicaid reimbursement, staffing mandates, labor market constraints
  Implication: Geographic policy >> organizational scale economies
  Status: HIGHLIGHTED IN SLIDES 8, 9, 10
