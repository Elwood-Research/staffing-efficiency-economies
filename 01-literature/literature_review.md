# Literature Review: Staffing Mix Efficiency and Economies of Scale in Nursing Homes

## Theoretical Framework

The research examining nursing home staffing mix and facility size operates within several interconnected theoretical perspectives. The foundational framework guiding this research area is **Donabedian's Structure-Process-Outcome Model**, which posits that care quality depends on the organizational structure (including staffing), the processes through which care is delivered, and ultimately resident outcomes. Within nursing homes, staffing levels and composition represent the structural component that influences care processes and ultimately determines resident health outcomes. A complementary framework is **Transaction Cost Economics**, which suggests that facility size affects the efficiency of operations through economies of scale—larger facilities may distribute fixed costs across more residents, potentially enabling more efficient staffing arrangements. However, larger facilities may also face increased coordination costs and complexity in managing diverse staffing arrangements.

**Agency Theory** provides another lens, particularly when examining the relationship between facility ownership, management incentives, and staffing decisions. For-profit nursing homes face different financial pressures than nonprofit facilities, which may influence staffing mix decisions and reliance on contract labor. Additionally, **Resource Dependency Theory** suggests that nursing home organizations adjust their staffing strategies based on labor market conditions and the availability of different worker types (RNs, LPNs, CNAs, contract workers). The interplay between these theoretical frameworks helps explain how and why facility size might influence staffing patterns, with larger facilities potentially better positioned to manage complex staffing arrangements while smaller facilities may rely more heavily on contract labor due to their inability to maintain consistent census or full-time equivalent positions.

## Synthesis by Theme

### Theme 1: Nursing Home Staffing Levels and Composition

Recent research has documented significant variation in nursing home staffing levels and the composition of the nursing workforce. Feng and colleagues (2008) examined long-term trends in nursing home staffing from 1996-2004, identifying how Medicaid reimbursement rates influenced facility-level staffing decisions. Their longitudinal analysis established that payment structures directly affected the hours per resident day (HPRD) devoted to registered nurses (RNs), licensed practical nurses (LPNs), and certified nursing assistants (CNAs). This foundational work demonstrated that staffing patterns are not random but rather respond to financial incentives and regulatory requirements.

More recent investigations have expanded this understanding. Shin and colleagues (2024) conducted a cross-sectional analysis of all U.S. nursing homes in fiscal year 2019, finding that facilities maintaining a total of 4.1 HPRD and RN HPRD of 0.75 experienced significantly fewer deficiency citations compared to facilities falling below these thresholds. This research revealed that larger facilities were more likely to have higher deficiency citations, suggesting that facility size itself may not automatically confer quality advantages despite potential economies of scale. Meanwhile, Kang and colleagues (2024) found that nursing home staffing disparities during the COVID-19 pandemic were most acute in distressed communities, with reductions particularly evident in RN hours (43% decline), LPN hours (15% decline), and CNA hours (11% decline), suggesting that facility location and community economic conditions shape staffing capacity and decisions.

The variation in staffing composition—particularly the ratio of RNs to LPNs to CNAs—emerges as a critical component of care delivery. Huang and colleagues (2025) demonstrated that Medicare Shared Savings Program (MSSP) participation was associated with increased RN staffing but reduced LPN staffing, suggesting that payment reforms can shift the skill mix toward higher-credentialed nursing staff. This finding carries important implications for understanding facility responses to regulatory and financial incentives, as facilities appear to substitute RN hours for LPN hours under value-based payment arrangements.

### Theme 2: Economies of Scale and Facility Size Efficiency

The relationship between facility size and operational efficiency has been examined through multiple economic lenses. Christensen (2003) applied quantile regression to estimate cost functions for nursing homes, finding that product-specific scale economies systematically increase across the cost distribution for both skilled and intermediate care facilities. Importantly, his analysis revealed diseconomies of scale in the lower deciles and no significant scale economies in the higher deciles, suggesting that the efficiency benefits of size are not uniformly distributed across the distribution of facilities. This heterogeneity indicates that the relationship between facility size and efficiency is more complex than simple linear models would suggest.

Farsi and colleagues (2008) examined economies of scale in Swiss nursing homes using stochastic frontier analysis, concluding that economies of scale represent an important potential source of cost reduction in a majority of Swiss nursing homes, yet the effect is not universal. Their findings suggest that optimal facility size varies depending on local labor market conditions, capital costs, and regulatory environments. The historical analysis by Chattopadhyay and Ray (1996) on Connecticut nursing homes demonstrated that both diseconomies of scale and size efficiency vary substantially across facilities, with some suggesting that multiple smaller units might be more efficient than a single large facility—a finding that challenges the assumption that "bigger is always more efficient."

These economic analyses suggest that the relationship between facility size and staffing efficiency is non-linear and contingent on multiple factors. Larger facilities may achieve cost advantages through bulk purchasing and administrative consolidation, but these gains may be offset by increased coordination complexity, potential staffing inefficiencies, and difficulties in maintaining consistent care quality. The evidence does not support a simple model in which larger facilities automatically achieve better staffing mix efficiency or superior quality outcomes.

### Theme 3: Contract Labor, Staffing Flexibility, and Financial Performance

The use of contract and temporary staffing has emerged as a significant aspect of nursing home labor strategies. Ghiasi and colleagues (2023) examined the relationship between contract nurse utilization and nursing home financial performance using Payroll-Based Journal (PBJ) data from 2017-2021. Their findings demonstrated a consistent negative association between contract nurse ratios and operating margin: a 10% increase in contract nurse ratios among RNs, LPNs, and CNAs was associated with 0.45%, 0.48%, and 0.52% decreases in operating margin, respectively. These findings indicate that while contract staffing may provide short-term flexibility in response to staffing shortages, it imposes significant financial costs that ultimately compromise facility financial viability.

Khoja and colleagues (2026) investigated the relationship between staffing patterns, including agency staff use, and injurious falls in nursing homes, finding that facilities relying more heavily on contract staff experienced higher rates of injurious falls, suggesting that staffing instability from agency personnel compromises resident safety. This research extends beyond financial considerations to highlight quality and safety implications of contract staffing reliance.

The data on contract labor use suggests an emerging pattern: while smaller or mid-sized facilities might face constraints that lead them to rely on contract staffing due to inability to maintain full-time equivalent positions, this strategy carries significant financial and quality costs. The inverted-U pattern hypothesized in the research question—whereby mid-sized facilities show peak contract CNA reliance—may reflect these facilities' struggle to balance financial viability with the need for flexibility in a competitive labor market where they lack the recruiting advantages of larger systems.

### Theme 4: Staffing Levels and Quality of Care Outcomes

The relationship between staffing levels and quality outcomes has been extensively documented in recent literature. Bowblis (2011) conducted a difference-in-differences analysis examining minimum staffing requirements in nursing homes, finding that while staffing ratios and quality measures were significantly correlated, the relationship was modest and context-dependent. His analysis of minimum direct care staffing requirements revealed that increases in overall staffing did not automatically translate to proportional improvements in quality metrics.

More recent work has refined this understanding. Benheim and colleagues (2025) used an event study framework with fixed effects analysis to examine staffing instability specifically, finding that a 10-day increase in "low outlier days" (defined as days with total direct care hours at least 20% below facility average) was associated with increased functional decline among long-stay residents with dementia. Critically, this relationship was strongest for CNA staffing instability, followed by LPN and RN staffing, suggesting that variation in staffing matters as much as—or potentially more than—average staffing levels.

Bowblis and Brunt (2024) examined California's 2018 staffing regulation changes, finding that while facilities increased staffing in response to mandates, only 3 of 13 quality measures examined showed statistically significant improvements. This research suggests that staffing requirements alone are insufficient to drive quality improvements without accompanying changes to care processes and organizational practices. Meanwhile, Cho and colleagues (2020) found that registered nurse staffing was particularly strongly associated with reduced quality deficiencies, suggesting that skill mix composition—not just total staffing—matters for quality outcomes.

The evidence collectively suggests that a positive but complex relationship exists between staffing and quality. The relationship is not linear; beyond certain thresholds, additional staffing may produce diminishing returns. The composition of the workforce (RN-to-LPN-to-CNA ratio) appears to be as important as total staffing hours. Staffing stability and consistency may be as important as staffing levels.

### Theme 5: Workforce Shortages, Retention, and Strategic Staffing Responses

Staffing challenges in nursing homes have been exacerbated by persistent workforce shortages. Lanoix (2021) examined two Canadian provincial initiatives during the COVID-19 pandemic, documenting how facilities implemented emergency staffing strategies including increased use of foreign healthcare workers and modified shift structures. Similarly, Brazier and colleagues (2023) conducted a mixed-methods study of 40 U.S. nursing homes, finding that administrators employed short-term compensatory strategies including mandatory overtime, staggered schedules, and increased reliance on contract workers to comply with minimum staffing regulations and offset shortages.

Levy and colleagues (2025) applied structural equation modeling to examine the organizational characteristics affecting nursing home staffing and care delivery, demonstrating that profit status, facility size, and Medicaid percentage significantly influenced staffing patterns through their effects on organizational structure and resources. Their analysis supported a comprehensive model in which organizational context shapes staffing decisions and care delivery capacity.

These workforce investigations suggest that nursing home staffing is not simply a matter of individual facility choices but rather reflects constrained decision-making within labor market realities. Smaller facilities and those with high Medicaid percentages face particular constraints, potentially forcing reliance on contract labor as a flexibility strategy even when it undermines financial performance.

### Theme 6: Regulatory Framework and Policy Contexts

The regulatory environment significantly shapes nursing home staffing decisions. Zhang and Grabowski (2004) examined staffing and quality outcomes under the Nursing Home Reform Act, finding that while regulation influenced staffing patterns, the relationship between regulatory compliance and quality outcomes was complex. Their analysis suggested that regulations establish a baseline but do not automatically ensure quality care.

More recent policy analyses have documented the evolution of staffing regulations. Halifax and Harrington (2022) provided critical commentary on the financial transparency issues affecting nursing home staffing, noting that despite estimates showing only 4.2% of national nursing home expenditures would be required to meet recommended minimum staffing levels (4.1 HPRD), widespread noncompliance persists due to financial diversion practices by for-profit operators rather than genuine funding insufficiency.

The 2024 CMS proposed rule for federal minimum staffing levels (3.48 HPRD) has become a focal point of policy discussions. While intended to establish a national baseline, this requirement remains below the 4.1 HPRD that recent evidence associates with lower deficiency rates, suggesting that even mandated minimums may be insufficient for quality assurance.

### Theme 7: COVID-19 Pandemic Impacts on Staffing

The COVID-19 pandemic revealed and exacerbated existing staffing vulnerabilities in nursing homes. Werner and Coe (2021) conducted a cross-sectional analysis showing that contrary to initial expectations, nursing home staffing levels did not change significantly during the pandemic's early phase, though the composition of staffing changed (with more reliance on agency personnel to replace permanent staff who withdrew during the acute crisis period). This finding suggests that while absolute staffing hours may have been maintained through regulatory pressure, the quality and continuity of care may have been compromised by increased reliance on temporary workers unfamiliar with facility operations and residents.

Dosil-Díaz and colleagues (2024) surveyed nursing home staff during the pandemic, finding high levels of burnout and psychological exhaustion, particularly among management professionals. This workforce mental health crisis has ongoing implications for staffing retention and turnover, potentially contributing to future staffing challenges that extend beyond the acute pandemic period.

## Research Gaps and Opportunities

The existing literature reveals several significant gaps that the proposed research addresses. First, while substantial research documents staffing levels and quality outcomes, limited work specifically examines how facility size influences the staffing mix efficiency ratio (RN-to-LPN ratios) while accounting for labor market dynamics, regulatory compliance costs, and financial constraints. The hypothesis that facility size produces an inverted-U relationship with contract CNA reliance has not been explicitly tested in the literature, despite its theoretical plausibility given transaction cost economics.

Second, the mechanisms by which facility size might influence staffing decisions remain underspecified. Is larger size associated with greater recruiting capacity for RNs, enabling higher RN-to-LPN ratios? Or do larger facilities face increased administrative complexity that requires allocating resources away from direct care staffing? The literature provides evidence consistent with both possibilities but lacks integrated analysis explaining when each mechanism dominates.

Third, the Payroll-Based Journal data now available since 2018 provides unprecedented opportunity for facility-level analysis of staffing patterns by facility size. While previous research relied on claims data, facility surveys, or limited samples, PBJ data enables comprehensive national examination of actual payroll records for nursing facilities, allowing precise measurement of contract labor use and staffing composition.

Fourth, the literature has documented that staffing instability matters for outcomes (Benheim et al., 2025), yet research has not systematically examined whether instability varies by facility size or whether the inverted-U pattern suggested for contract labor extends to overall staffing variability.

## Summary

The current literature establishes that nursing home staffing decisions involve complex interactions between facility characteristics (including size), labor market conditions, regulatory requirements, financial constraints, and organizational management practices. The relationship between facility size and staffing efficiency is non-linear rather than monotonic, with evidence suggesting both economies of scale (particularly in administrative functions) and diseconomies of scale (particularly in coordination and quality assurance). Contract labor use is financially costly and associated with quality and safety concerns, yet appears to be a strategic response by facilities facing workforce shortages and inflexible staffing requirements.

The proposed research advances this literature by examining the specific hypothesis that facility size influences the staffing mix efficiency (RN-to-LPN ratio) and contract CNA reliance in a non-linear pattern using comprehensive Payroll-Based Journal data. By testing these hypotheses empirically with facility-level data, the research will clarify the mechanisms by which facility size affects staffing decisions and identify whether larger facilities achieve true efficiency advantages or whether they simply face different (rather than fewer) operational challenges. This understanding is critical for policy discussions about optimal nursing home size, efficiency, and quality assurance in an industry facing persistent staffing challenges and financial pressures.
