## KEY FINDINGS SYNTHESIS

### Primary Theme in H1 Contradiction
**"Cost minimization and regulatory constraint trump economies of scale"**
- Larger facilities operate with proportionally more LPNs (lower RN-to-LPN ratios)
- This contradicts predictions of size-driven efficiency but aligns with:
  - Regulatory ceiling hypothesis (CMS standards set baselines, not ceilings)
  - Labor market constraint (RN shortage prevents larger facilities from increasing RN ratios)
  - Cost minimization (LPNs/CNAs cheaper; larger facilities may choose cost-focused strategies)

### Primary Theme in H2 Non-Support
**"State factors override facility size; contract labor is operationally determined"**
- No inverted-U pattern for contract CNA use across facility sizes
- Contract labor uniformly distributed (~5.9% mean, 1.9% median)
- State effects explain 11× more variance (R² = 0.12) than facility size (R² = 0.01)
- Geographic variation (Vermont +0.109 to Arkansas -0.067) suggests state regulation, labor supply, or Medicaid reimbursement drives contract labor use, not facility size

### Cross-Cutting Theme
**"External constraints (regulation, labor supply, state policy) dominate internal organizational characteristics (size) as determinants of staffing"**

## LITERATURE CONNECTION SUMMARY

### Citation Count by Finding
- **Finding 1 (Lower RN-to-LPN)**: 8 citations analyzed (contradictions: Christensen, Blegen, Bowblis; alignments: Farsi, Chattopadhyay, Huang, Levy)
- **Finding 2 (Flat Contract CNA)**: 3 citations analyzed (Ghiasi, Khoja, Brazier)
- **Finding 3 (State Dominance)**: 4 citations analyzed (Kang, Zhang & Grabowski, Halifax & Harrington, Feng)

## RECOMMENDATIONS FOR PHASE 6

### For Manuscript Writer:
1. **Use finding_interpretations.md as starting point** for Results and Discussion paragraphs
2. **Reference literature_connection.md** when citing studies to ensure accurate contextualization
3. **Follow discussion_outline.md** for Discussion section structure, using provided prompts
4. **Weave synthesis_narrative.md context** into introduction and discussion for theoretical coherence

### Document Organization:
- Introduction (3-4 pages): Use theoretical framework from synthesis_narrative sections 1 and 5
- Methods (2-3 pages): Unchanged from Phase 3 documentation
- Results (4-5 pages): Use finding_interpretations.md for paragraph text + Tables/Figures from Phase 4
- Discussion (4-5 pages): Follow discussion_outline.md section by section with literature citations
- References: 37 citations from 01-literature/references.bib (minimum 20 required; EXCEEDED)

### Hypothesis Framing:
- **H1**: State as "contradicted" (not "not supported") to emphasize surprising finding
- **H2**: State as "not supported; flat relationship observed" with attention to state effects dominance

### Figures Integration:
- Integrate all 6 figures from Phase 4 analysis at their first mention
- Use finding_interpretations.md framework to provide 2-3 paragraphs interpretation for each figure
- Include STROBE diagram as required for peer-reviewed publication
