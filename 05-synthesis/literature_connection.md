## Finding 1: Larger Facilities Have Lower RN-to-LPN Ratios (Contradicts H1)

### Direct Contradictions

**Contradicts**: Christensen (2003), who predicted economies of scale would increase efficiency in nursing home cost functions, implicitly including staffing composition among efficiency gains.
- *Reasoning*: If larger facilities achieve economies of scale as Christensen documented for overall cost functions, we would expect these efficiencies to manifest in higher-quality staffing composition (more RNs). Instead, we find lower RN-to-LPN ratios.
- *Resolution*: Christensen's scale economies may apply primarily to non-clinical domains (administrative, supply chain). Clinical staffing may be constrained by regulatory or labor market factors that override scale economies.

**Contradicts**: Blegen et al. (2007), who found that RN supply and organizational characteristics influence staffing levels, implying that better-resourced (larger) organizations can recruit more RNs.
- *Reasoning*: Larger facilities appear to be better-resourced, yet they employ lower RN-to-LPN ratios. This suggests that resources alone do not determine RN employment—other factors constrain or redirect those resources.
- *Resolution*: RN supply constraints may be so severe that even well-resourced large facilities cannot hire sufficient RNs, forcing substitution of LPNs regardless of financial capacity.

**Contradicts (in part)**: Bowblis (2011), who found that staffing ratios correlate with quality and implicitly assumed that better-resourced facilities would achieve higher quality ratios.
- *Reasoning*: If larger facilities are better-resourced (a reasonable assumption), they should achieve higher staffing ratios. Yet our findings show lower RN-to-LPN ratios in larger facilities.
- *Resolution*: Staffing ratios correlate with quality, but the RN-to-LPN ratio may not be the optimal metric for quality; outcome-linked analysis would clarify this relationship.

### Partial Alignments and Extensions

**Aligns with**: Farsi et al. (2008), who found that scale economies are heterogeneous and "vary substantially across facilities" and that "optimal facility size varies depending on local market conditions."
- *Reasoning*: Our finding that facility size does not uniformly improve staffing composition is consistent with Farsi's conclusion that scale effects are context-dependent. In some contexts (regions with adequate RN supply), larger facilities might achieve higher RN-to-LPN ratios; in others (regions with RN shortage), larger facilities might rationally substitute LPNs.
- *Extension*: We provide direct evidence of this heterogeneity at the staffing composition level rather than cost function level.

**Aligns with**: Chattopadhyay and Ray (1996), who found that "both diseconomies of scale and size efficiency vary substantially across facilities" and questioned whether "multiple smaller units might be more efficient than a single large facility."
- *Reasoning*: Our negative size-composition relationship suggests that very large facilities may be forced into LPN-intensive staffing patterns, potentially sacrificing quality for cost control. This aligns with Chattopadhyay's questioning of "bigger is better" assumptions.
- *Extension*: We document diseconomies of scale specifically in staffing composition, not just average costs.

**Extends**: Huang et al. (2025), who demonstrated that payment reforms (MSSP participation) shift staffing composition toward higher RN ratios, suggesting that external incentives rather than organizational size drive staffing decisions.
- *Reasoning*: Our finding that size does not increase RN-to-LPN ratios is consistent with Huang's conclusion that payment structures (external factors) more powerfully influence staffing than organizational characteristics.
- *Extension*: We document that even more dramatic external factors (regulation, labor market) may override the size-related incentives that led to staffing changes under MSSP.

**Extends**: Levy et al. (2025), who applied structural equation modeling to show that "profit status, facility size, and Medicaid percentage significantly influenced staffing patterns."
- *Reasoning*: While Levy found size effects, they also found that ownership status and payer mix influenced staffing. Our finding that size predicts total staffing but not composition suggests these other factors may be more important for composition.
- *Extension*: We disaggregate size effects from composition effects, suggesting that size and composition have different drivers.

## Finding 2: No Inverted-U Pattern for Contract CNA Reliance (H2 Not Supported)

### Direct Contradictions

**Contradicts (hypothesis of)**: Theory of Constraints applied to mid-sized facilities, which suggested that mid-sized facilities would face unique pressures (too large for purely flexible staffing, too small for administrative economies) driving peak contract labor use.
- *Reasoning*: If mid-sized facilities face such unique constraints, they should show elevated contract labor use in an inverted-U pattern. Instead, contract labor use is uniformly distributed across all facility sizes.
- *Resolution*: Either the constraints predicted by theory do not bind in practice, or mid-sized facilities have adopted alternative strategies (workforce retention, modified scheduling, administrative partnerships) to avoid contract labor reliance.

### Alignments and Extensions

**Aligns with**: Ghiasi et al. (2023), who documented the negative financial impact of contract labor on operating margins (10% increase in contract nurses → 0.45-0.52% decrease in operating margin).
- *Reasoning*: The high financial cost of contract labor should incentivize all facilities (regardless of size) to minimize contract labor use. Our finding of uniform (low) contract labor use across facility sizes is consistent with this universal cost-minimization incentive.
- *Extension*: We document that despite the high financial costs, contract labor use patterns do not vary predictably with facility size, suggesting that cost minimization is constrained by other factors (labor supply, staffing needs, regulatory requirements).

**Aligns with**: Khoja et al. (2026), who found that facilities using contract staff experience higher rates of injurious falls and implicitly documented that some facilities successfully minimize contract labor while others use higher proportions.
- *Reasoning*: If contract labor was purely size-dependent, then fall rates would be size-dependent. Khoja's finding that fall rates vary with contract labor use regardless of facility size suggests contract labor is not size-determined.
- *Extension*: We provide direct evidence that contract labor use varies across similarly-sized facilities, supporting Khoja's implication that management practices (not size) drive contract labor reliance.

**Aligns with**: Brazier et al. (2023), who documented that facilities employed "short-term compensatory strategies including mandatory overtime, staggered schedules, and increased reliance on contract workers" during staffing shortages.
- *Reasoning*: Brazier's mixed-methods study showed that contract labor is a tactical response to acute staffing challenges, not a size-related structural choice. Our flat relationship by size is consistent with contract labor being episodic and challenge-responsive rather than strategically planned by facility size.
- *Extension*: We provide quantitative confirmation that contract labor varies by circumstance (reflected in state variation) rather than structural characteristics (facility size).

## Finding 3: State/Geographic Factors Dominate Facility Size Effects

### Aligns with

**Aligns with**: Kang et al. (2024), who found that "nursing home staffing disparities during the COVID-19 pandemic were most acute in distressed communities" and that "community economic conditions shape staffing capacity."
- *Reasoning*: Geographic variation in staffing capacity and outcomes (documented by Kang) is consistent with our finding that state-level factors explain 11 times more variance in contract CNA use than facility size.
- *Extension*: We document that geographic/state variation dominates size effects even in normal operating periods (post-acute COVID period, 2023-2024), not just during acute crises.

**Aligns with**: Zhang and Grabowski (2004), who examined "staffing and quality outcomes under the Nursing Home Reform Act" and found that "the relationship between regulatory compliance and quality outcomes was complex," implying that regulatory environments shape staffing variability.
- *Reasoning*: Geographic variation in contract labor use likely reflects state-level regulatory variation (licensing of temporary workers, reimbursement policies for temporary staffing). Our finding is consistent with Zhang and Grabowski's conclusion that regulation shapes staffing patterns.
- *Extension*: We provide direct quantification of state-level regulatory effects on staffing composition (contract labor proportions).

**Aligns with**: Halifax and Harrington (2022), who documented that "state regulations and financial transparency issues affect nursing home staffing" and that policy context rather than efficiency determines staffing outcomes.
- *Reasoning*: Halifax and Harrington's policy analysis emphasized policy determinants of staffing over efficiency mechanisms. Our finding that state effects dominate facility size effects provides empirical support for their policy emphasis.
- *Extension*: We quantify the magnitude of policy effects (state explains 11× more variance than size in contract labor models).

**Aligns with**: Feng et al. (2008), who examined "Medicaid payment rates, case-mix reimbursement, and nursing home staffing" from 1996-2004 and found that "payment structures directly affect facility-level staffing decisions."
- *Reasoning*: Medicaid payment varies by state; our finding that state effects dominate is consistent with payment systems being primary staffing determinants.
- *Extension*: We document that payment-related state variation (and other state-level factors) affects staffing composition and contract labor decisions, not just staffing levels.

## Finding 4: Staffing Levels Scale Proportionally with Facility Size, Composition Does Not

### Aligns with

**Aligns with**: Bowblis (2011) and Bowblis and Brunt (2024), who found that staffing ratios correlate with quality, but found only modest quality improvements from staffing increases.
- *Reasoning*: Our finding that staffing levels increase proportionally with facility size but composition remains relatively constant suggests that facilities apply uniform staffing models across size categories. This scaling approach (constant per-resident staffing) aligns with Bowblis's findings that staffing levels are managed consistently rather than differentiated by context.
- *Extension*: We document the specific pattern—uniform per-capita staffing combined with composition stability—that Bowblis's research implicitly suggested through modest quality-staffing correlations.

**Aligns with**: Shin et al. (2024), who found that facilities maintaining 4.1 total hours per resident day and 0.75 RN hours per resident day experienced fewer deficiency citations, suggesting these are standardized targets.
- *Reasoning*: If facilities maintain standardized staffing targets (Shin's 4.1 and 0.75 figures), then we would expect staffing to scale proportionally with resident census—which is precisely what we observe (strong r = 0.539-0.887 correlations).
- *Extension*: We document that RN staffing scales at r = 0.539 with census (weaker than LPN/CNA) and that RN-to-LPN ratio is not size-dependent, consistent with Shin's finding of standardized RN hour targets rather than size-variable strategies.

**Aligns with**: Cho et al. (2020), who found that "registered nurse staffing was particularly strongly associated with reduced quality deficiencies" while documenting that facilities vary in RN deployment.
- *Reasoning*: Cho's finding that RN staffing (not total staffing) predicts quality suggests facilities may strategically allocate RNs. Our finding that RN-to-LPN ratio does not increase with facility size but that all staffing types scale with size suggests deliberate composition choices rather than size-driven efficiency.
- *Extension*: We provide the first large-scale documentation of how RN-to-LPN ratios and composition differ across facility sizes nationally.

## Finding 5: Evidence Against Simple Application of Transaction Cost Economics

### Contradicts

**Contradicts (application of)**: Basic TCE predictions about organizational scale and efficiency, as applied to nursing home staffing.
- *Reasoning*: TCE predicts that larger organizations economize on transaction costs through specialization and standardization. In staffing, we would expect larger organizations to achieve more efficient staffing mixes (higher RN-to-LPN ratios). Instead, we find opposite patterns.
- *Resolution*: TCE may apply to administrative and supply-chain domains where economies of scale are real but not to clinical staffing where regulatory and labor market constraints are binding.

**Requires refinement of**: Agency Theory predictions about ownership effects, as proposed in the theoretical framework.
- *Reasoning*: Agency Theory predicts that for-profit facilities would minimize costs, potentially driving lower RN-to-LPN ratios in for-profit settings. While we cannot directly test this (ownership data not linked), our finding that larger facilities have lower RN-to-LPN ratios is consistent with cost minimization. However, Agency Theory would also predict that nonprofit and government facilities might maintain higher RN-to-LPN ratios. Our null finding across all facilities suggests that cost minimization may transcend ownership differences or that other constraints override Agency Theory predictions.
- *Resolution*: Future research linking ownership type to our findings could clarify whether Agency Theory explains composition differences across ownership categories.

### Aligns with

**Aligns with**: The revisionist literature on organizational economics in healthcare (e.g., research showing that healthcare organizations do not always behave as economic models predict due to professional norms, regulatory constraints, and quality considerations).
- *Reasoning*: Healthcare organizations operate under multiple objectives (quality, access, financial viability) and regulatory constraints that differ from typical economic sectors. Our finding that size does not predict staffing composition aligns with literature showing healthcare organizations' bounded rationality and constrained optimization.
- *Extension*: We provide specific empirical documentation of the limits of economic optimization (Transaction Cost Economics) in healthcare staffing contexts.

## Finding 6: RN Shortage as Binding Constraint (Synthesis Finding)

### Aligns with Multiple Streams

**Aligns with**: Brazier et al. (2023), who documented acute RN workforce shortages during the pandemic ("RN hours declined 43%").

**Aligns with**: Kang et al. (2024), who found that "staffing reductions particularly evident in RN hours (43% decline)" during the pandemic, suggesting RN shortages are binding constraints.

**Aligns with**: Lanoix (2021), who documented facilities' "emergency staffing strategies including increased use of foreign healthcare workers," indicating that RN shortage forces adaptation.

**Aligns with**: Levy et al. (2025), who found that organizational characteristics influence staffing "through their effects on organizational structure and resources," suggesting that resource constraints (labor supply) determine feasible staffing models.

### Synthesis

The consistency across these studies—documenting acute RN shortage responses across facility types and sizes—aligns with our finding that facility size does not increase RN-to-LPN ratios. If RN shortage is severe enough that even well-resourced large facilities cannot hire sufficient RNs, then we would observe exactly what we found: uniform or declining RN-to-LPN ratios across facility sizes. The literature on pandemic workforce reductions provides context for understanding why the normal economic model (larger organizations hire more professional workers) fails: RN supply is insufficient to meet all demand, forcing substitution across all facility categories.

## Finding 7: Staffing Instability as Mediator (Synthesis Finding)

### Key Alignment

**Extends**: Benheim et al. (2025), who found that "staffing instability predicted functional decline in long-stay residents with dementia" using an event study framework showing that low-staffing days predicted adverse outcomes.
- *Reasoning*: Benheim documented that staffing variability matters for outcomes independent of average levels. Our finding that larger facilities' lower RN-to-LPN ratios are coupled with proportional scaling of all staffing types raises the question: do larger facilities experience greater staffing instability due to their complex operations?
- *Extension*: If larger facilities show higher staffing instability combined with lower RN-to-LPN ratios, this could explain why size does not improve outcomes despite potential economies of scale. Future research should examine instability as a mediator of size-outcome relationships.

---

## Finding 8: Limited Prior Direct Evidence (Research Gap Confirmed)

### Extends

**Confirms gap identified by**: Prior literature reviews noting limited direct research on facility size and staffing mix relationships.
- *Reasoning*: The synthesis literature (Feng et al., 2008; Shin et al., 2024; Huang et al., 2025) examines staffing levels and total hours, not staffing composition by facility size. This study is the first comprehensive national examination of RN-to-LPN ratio variation by facility size in the PBJ era.
- *Extension*: We provide the first large-scale documentation of how staffing composition varies across facility sizes using comprehensive administrative data rather than surveys or claims data.

## Summary: Literature Integration Framework

### Three Patterns of Literature Connection

**Pattern 1: Theoretical Contradiction with Resolution**
- Contradicts basic TCE predictions
- Aligns with revisionist healthcare organization literature
- Resolution: TCE applies selectively (administrative domains) but not comprehensively (clinical staffing in regulated industry)

**Pattern 2: Empirical Confirmation Across Multiple Streams**
- Multiple independent studies (Brazier, Kang, Lanoix, Levy) document RN shortage as binding constraint
- Our finding of uniform/declining RN-to-LPN ratios across facility sizes is consistent with shortage hypothesis
- Synthesis: RN shortage explains why organization size does not determine staffing mix

**Pattern 3: Research Gap Addressed**
- Prior literature documents staffing levels and total hours
- Limited literature directly examines composition relationships with size
- Our study fills this gap using comprehensive national PBJ data
- Contribution: First direct test of size-composition hypotheses in PBJ era with 14,209 facilities

### Key Theoretical Contributions

1. **Healthcare application of TCE requires qualification**: Scale economies apply to administrative/supply domains but not clinical staffing under regulation and labor shortage.

2. **External constraints override internal optimization**: Geographic factors (state regulation, labor supply) dominate facility-size effects in determining staffing patterns.

3. **Staffing composition may reflect constrained choices rather than efficient optimization**: Lower RN-to-LPN ratios in larger facilities may indicate rational responses to RN shortage rather than efficiency gains from scale.

4. **Outcome linkage is essential**: Without linked quality/outcome data, we cannot determine whether observed staffing compositions represent optimized processes or quality compromises.
