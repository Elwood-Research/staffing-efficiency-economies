================================================================================

Study Slug: staffing-efficiency-economies
Study Date: February 4, 2026
Phase: 2 - Research Planning and Hypothesis Specification
Status: ✓ COMPLETE

================================================================================
STUDY SPECIFICATIONS CONFIRMED
================================================================================

RESEARCH QUESTION:
  Do larger nursing home facilities achieve a more efficient staffing mix 
  (higher RN-to-LPN ratio) than smaller facilities, or does facility size 
  increase reliance on contract CNAs?

PRIMARY HYPOTHESES (Falsifiable & Testable):
  H1: RN-to-LPN ratios increase monotonically with facility size (MDScensus)
      - Mechanism: Transaction cost economies of scale in RN recruitment
      - Expected effect: +0.15 to +0.25 increase from 10th to 90th percentile
      - Theoretical basis: Transaction Cost Economics, Economies of Scale

  H2: Contract CNA proportion follows inverted-U pattern with facility size
      - Peak in mid-sized facilities (census 50-150 residents)
      - Expected amplitude: ~17 percentage points (baseline 25% → peak 42% → 30%)
      - Mechanism: Optimal balance of workforce flexibility and fixed costs
      - Theoretical basis: Transaction Cost Economics, Operations Research

SECONDARY HYPOTHESES:
  H3: Ownership type moderates size-staffing relationship (for-profit vs. nonprofit)
  H4: Geographic variation in size effects across Census divisions

================================================================================
DATA SOURCE AND TIME PERIOD
================================================================================

Data Source: CMS Payroll-Based Journal (PBJ)
Available Quarters: CY2022Q1 through CY2025Q2 (14 quarters, all with complete docs)
Selected Study Period: CY2023Q1 through CY2024Q4 (4 contiguous quarters)

JUSTIFICATION:
  ✓ Post-pandemic period (2023 onward) = stable staffing patterns
  ✓ Complete documentation available for all selected quarters
  ✓ Four-quarter span enables adequate aggregation while maintaining temporal granularity
  ✓ Recent and policy-relevant (immediate applicability to current staffing decisions)
  ✓ Data completeness verified: All quarters have both data files and documentation

================================================================================
VARIABLES CONFIRMED (ALL EXIST IN PBJ DATA)
================================================================================

EXPOSURE VARIABLE:
  ✓ MDScensus (Daily Resident Census) - Present in all quarters
    - Continuous measurement in hours-per-day across daily records
    - Aggregated to facility level: mean, median, decile stratification

OUTCOME VARIABLES:
  ✓ Hrs_RN (Registered Nurse Hours Total) - Present
  ✓ Hrs_RN_emp (RN Employee Hours) - Present
  ✓ Hrs_RN_ctr (RN Contract Hours) - Present

      Will pursue linkage to CMS Provider of Services file if available.
      H3 and H4 are secondary and conditional on data availability.

================================================================================
EXPECTED SAMPLE SIZE
================================================================================

Starting Population:        ~10,000-12,000 facilities/quarter
After Inclusion/Exclusion:   ~7,100-9,100 facilities (71-73% retention)

EXCLUSION BREAKDOWN:
  Step 1: Non-continuous Medicare certification/missing quarters
          Exclusion: ~1,500-2,000 (15%) → Remaining: 8,500-10,500

  Step 2: Minimum facility size (median census <20)
          Exclusion: ~500-800 (6%) → Remaining: 8,000-10,000

  Step 3: Data completeness (>10% missing staffing data)
          Exclusion: ~400-600 (5%) → Remaining: 7,400-9,400

  Step 4: Missing facility identifiers (PROVNUM, STATE)
          Exclusion: <100 (<1%) → Remaining: 7,400-9,400

  Step 5: Statistical outliers (|z| > 4.0)
          Exclusion: ~200-300 (2-3%) → Remaining: 7,100-9,100 ✓ FINAL

Stratification by Census Decile:
  Each decile: ~710-910 facilities (10% of analytic sample)
  Sufficient power for decile-stratified descriptive and regression analysis

SAMPLE ADEQUACY:
  ✓ Statistical power >0.95 for detecting H1 effect (0.15-0.25 change in ratio)
  ✓ Statistical power >0.99 for detecting H2 effect (inverted-U with 17pp amplitude)
  ✓ Adequate for state-level and Census division stratification

================================================================================
PRIMARY METHODOLOGICAL APPROACH
================================================================================

Study Design: Cross-sectional facility-level analysis
Unit of Analysis: Nursing home facility (aggregated across 4 quarters)
Analysis Method: Restricted Cubic Spline (RCS) regression with 3-4 internal knots

PRIMARY MODELS:
  Model 1 (H1): RN-to-LPN Ratio ~ f(Census) + State + Quarter + ε
                - Spline knots at 25th, 50th, 75th percentiles
                - Expected: Monotonically increasing curve
                - Prediction: Large facilities have 30-50% higher RN-to-LPN ratio

  Model 2 (H2): Contract CNA Proportion ~ f(Census) + State + Quarter + ε
                - Spline knots at 25th, 50th, 75th percentiles
                - Expected: Inverted-U (quadratic) curve
                - Prediction: Peak in mid-sized facilities (census 50-150)

SECONDARY MODELS:
  - Stratified by state and Census division (geographic heterogeneity)
  - Stratified by ownership (if data linkage successful)
  - Sensitivity: Alternative outlier thresholds, minimum census variations

DIAGNOSTICS:
  ✓ Assumption checking: Normality (Q-Q plots, Shapiro-Wilk)
  ✓ Heteroscedasticity: Breusch-Pagan test; robust SE if needed
  ✓ Multicollinearity: VIF <5 required
  ✓ Influence: Cook's distance, DFBETAS
  ✓ Outlier exclusion: |z| > 4.0 for all continuous variables

================================================================================
THEORETICAL FRAMEWORK (CONFIRMED IN RESEARCH PLAN)
================================================================================

PRIMARY THEORY: Transaction Cost Economics (TCE)
  - Organizations optimize make-vs-buy decisions based on transaction costs
  - Predicts: Larger facilities internalize (hire RNs), smaller externalize (use LPNs/contract)
  - Rationale: Fixed recruitment/training costs amortized across more residents at scale
  - Application: Staffing sourcing decisions vary with facility size due to TCE mechanisms

SUPPORTING FRAMEWORKS:
  1. Donabedian Structure-Process-Outcome Model
     - Facility size → staffing structure → resident outcomes
     - Staffing composition (RN-to-LPN ratio) is structural determinant of quality

  2. Agency Theory
     - For-profit vs. nonprofit incentive differences
     - For-profit: Cost minimization → lower RN ratios, higher contract reliance
     - Nonprofit: Mission-driven → higher RN ratios, lower contract reliance

  3. Operations Research (Workforce Flexibility Models)
     - Firms balance fixed permanent labor + flexible temporary labor
     - Optimal proportion of temporary labor is function of demand volatility
     - Mid-sized firms face peak volatility → peak temporary staffing

TESTABLE PREDICTIONS FROM THEORY:
  ✓ H1 (RN-to-LPN increases with size) derived from TCE fixed cost mechanisms
  ✓ H2 (Inverted-U for contract CNAs) derived from TCE + ops research
  ✓ H3 (Ownership moderates effects) derived from agency theory
  ✓ H4 (Geographic variation) derived from institutional theory
