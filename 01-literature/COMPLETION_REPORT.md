## Research Context

### Primary Research Question
**Do larger nursing home facilities achieve a more efficient staffing mix (higher RN-to-LPN ratio) than smaller facilities, or does facility size increase reliance on contract CNAs?**

### Hypotheses to be Tested (from literature)
1. **H1**: RN-to-LPN ratios increase with facility size
2. **H2**: Contract CNA reliance peaks in mid-sized facilities (inverted-U pattern)

### Theoretical Basis
- Transaction cost economics predicts non-linear size-efficiency relationship
- Donabedian framework positions staffing as structural determinant of outcomes
- Agency theory explains ownership-staffing relationship variations

### Data Strategy
- **Primary Data**: Payroll-Based Journal (PBJ) 2018-2025 facility-level data
- **Unit of Analysis**: Individual nursing facilities
- **Key Variables**:
  - Facility size: Median daily census (MDScensus)
  - RN-to-LPN ratio: HPRD RN / HPRD LPN
  - Contract CNA reliance: % CNA hours from contract workers
  - Controls: Medicaid %, ownership, location, quality metrics

## Next Steps for Research Team

1. **Study Design Finalization**: Use literature review to refine analytic approach
2. **Variable Definition**: Operationalize concepts using definitions suggested by literature
3. **Analysis Plan**: Design analyses aligned with literature on confounders and mechanisms
4. **Manuscript Development**: Reference literature review when writing Introduction and Discussion
5. **Policy Positioning**: Use synthesis section for positioning study's policy implications

## Researcher Notes

### Strengths of Collected Literature
1. **Recent and Current**: Heavy representation of 2020+ research, including 2026 publications
2. **Directly Relevant**: Multiple papers specifically on nursing home staffing and facility size
3. **Methodologically Diverse**: Mix of econometric, epidemiologic, and qualitative approaches
4. **Policy-Focused**: Many papers directly address regulatory and financial implications
5. **Comprehensive Coverage**: All six topic areas well-represented

### Literature Limitations
1. **Direct Size-Staffing Mix Evidence**: Limited papers explicitly examine RN-to-LPN by facility size
2. **Contract Labor Focus**: Only 2 papers directly examine contract labor patterns
3. **Mechanism Clarity**: Reasons *why* size influences staffing remain underspecified
4. **Inverted-U Pattern**: Specific hypothesis not directly tested in extant literature

### Study Positioning
This literature review establishes that the proposed research addresses a **specific, important gap** in understanding how facility size influences staffing composition and efficiency. While literature documents staffing levels, quality outcomes, and general efficiency patterns, the **direct relationship between facility size and staffing mix efficiency** (particularly the inverted-U hypothesis for contract labor) remains empirically untested.
